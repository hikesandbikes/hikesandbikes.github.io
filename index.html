		<p>A few days ago I was fortunate to pick up a copy of a book that had a
		major impact on my early career as kernel engineer;</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		  <p><em>The Design and Implementation of the 4.3 BSD UNIX Operating System by
		Samuel J. Leffler, Marshall Kirk McKusick, Michael J. Karels and John
		S. Quarterman</em>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>It was the first authoritative description of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">Berkeley
		UNIX</a>, its
		design and implementation. The book covers the internal structure of the
		4.3 BSD systems and the concepts, data structures and algorithms used in
		implementing the system facilities. But most importantly it was written
		by practitioners and builders and as such gave insights that academic
		text book would never give you.</p>
		
		<p>In those days I was doing an internship at
		<a href="https://www.nikhef.nl/">NIKHEF</a> who were still using a collection of
		PDP 11s and one of my tasks was to get BSD2.9 to run on them. Lots of
		late nights and head scratching, but got it done eventually. I did learn
		how to boot from tape, over and over again (Zen!!). When I returned to
		school, they were about to decommission a PDP 11. I convinced them to
		put it in a old (big) cleaning closet, upgrade the power to the room,
		and I went right back to building out my BSD kernel expertise. I started
		late at Computer Science (28) but worked hard to catch up by getting my
		hands dirty.</p>
		
		<p>When I posted on twitter I found of the book, many of our peers came up
		with a list of other books I had also read from that era.</p>

		<p>One of the most rewarding parts of my job is getting to watch different
		industries implement new technologies that improve and transform
		business operations. Manufacturing, in particular, has always captivated
		my attention in this respect. When I think about how Amazon’s globally
		connected distribution network has changed in the last decade alone,
		it’s incredible. From the Internet of Things (IoT) to Artificial
		Intelligence (AI) and task automation to predictive maintenance
		technology, the advancements in this space are creating a world of new
		opportunity.</p>
		
		<p>But this is complicated by that fact that many manufacturers have been
		around for decades or longer. Some of their equipment was designed
		before the internet even existed. If replacing this equipment isn’t an
		option, how do these manufacturers begin their journey to modern
		manufacturing? The choice of what to embrace and where to start can be
		daunting.</p>
		
		<p>Ultimately, the reason for adopting any new technology in manufacturing
		is usually to achieve one or more of the following objectives: produce
		more, increase safety, or increase quality—and all at a lower cost.
		The good news is that the most important thing a manufacturer needs to
		accomplish with any of these objectives is something they already have.
		It’s something they’ve had since the moment they opened their doors,
		whether that was yesterday or 100 years ago: data.</p>

		<p>The global healthcare pandemic has been like nothing many of us in
		Europe have ever known. During this time, many organizations have been
		contemplating their role in the COVID-19 crisis, and how they can best
		serve their communities. I can tell you it has been no different for us
		at Amazon Web Services (AWS). We are focused on where we can make the
		biggest difference, to help the global communities in which we all live

		(Milan) Region is now

		<p>La maggior parte di noi, in Europa, non aveva mai conosciuto prima una
		pandemia globale come quella in corso. Durante questo periodo, molte
		organizzazioni stanno riflettendo sul proprio ruolo nella crisi COVID-19
		e su quale può essere il modo migliore per supportare la propria
		comunità. Posso dirvi che per noi di Amazon Web Services (AWS) non è
		stato diverso. Ci siamo concentrati su come e dove avremmo potuto fare
		la differenza più grande aiutando le comunità globali in cui viviamo e
		lavoriamo. Con questo obiettivo in mente, oggi annunciamo <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/local/italy/milan/">l'apertura
		della Regione AWS Europe
		(Milano)</a>. Il lancio della
		Regione AWS in Italia conferma il nostro costante impegno per gli
		italiani e rafforza ulteriormente il nostro sostegno al grande
		potenziale del paese.</p>

		<p>On March 16, 2020, at 9:26 PM, I received an urgent email from my friend
		DJ Patil, former White House Chief Data Scientist, Head of Technology
		for Devoted Health, a Senior Fellow at the Belfer Center at the Harvard
		Kennedy School, and Advisor to Venrock Partners. You don’t get that many
		titles after your name unless you’re pretty good at something. For DJ,
		that “something” is math and computer science.</p>
		
		<p>DJ was writing to me from the California crisis command center. He
		explained that he was working with governors from across the country to
		model the potential impact of COVID-19 for scenario planning. He wanted
		to help them answer critical questions, like “How many hospital beds
		will we need?” and “Can we reduce the spread if we temporarily close
		places where people gather?” and “Should we issue a shelter-in-place
		order and for how long?” While nobody can predict the future, modeling
		the virus with all the factors they <em>did know</em> was their best shot at
		helping leaders make informed decisions, which would impact hundreds of
		thousands of lives.</p>

		<p>Back when Jeff Bezos filled orders in his garage and drove packages to the post office himself, crunching the numbers on costs, tracking inventory, and forecasting future demand was relatively simple. Fast-forward 25 years, Amazon's retail business has more than 175 <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/amazon-fulfillment/our-fulfillment-centers/">fulfillment centers</a> (FC) worldwide with over 250,000 full-time associates shipping millions of items per day.</p>
		
		<p>Amazon's worldwide financial operations team has the incredible task of tracking all of that data (think petabytes).  At Amazon's scale, a miscalculated metric, like cost per unit, or delayed data can have a huge impact (think millions of dollars). The team is constantly looking for ways to get more accurate data, faster.</p>
		
		<p>That's why, in 2019, they had an idea: Build a data lake that can support one of the largest logistics networks on the planet. It would later become known internally as the Galaxy data lake. The Galaxy data lake was built in 2019 and now all the various teams are working on moving their data into it.</p>
		
		<p>A data lake is a centralized secure repository that allows you to store, govern, discover, and share all of your structured and unstructured data at any scale. Data lakes don't require a pre-defined schema, so you can process raw data without having to know what insights you might want to explore in the future. The following figure shows the key components of a data lake.</p>

		<p>Have you ever received a call from your bank because they suspected fraudulent activity? Most banks can automatically identify when spending patterns or locations have deviated from the norm and then act immediately. Many times, this happens before victims even noticed that something was off.  As a result, the impact of identity theft on a person's bank account and life can be managed before it's even an issue.</p>
		
		<p>Having a deep understanding of the relationships in your data is powerful like that.</p>
		
		<p>Consider the relationships between diseases and gene interactions. By understanding these connections, you can search for patterns within protein pathways to find other genes that may be associated with a disease. This kind of information could help advance disease research.</p>
		
		<p>The deeper the understanding of the relationships, the more powerful the insights. With enough relationship data points, you can even make predictions about the future (like with a recommendation engine). But as more data is connected, and the size and complexity of the connected data increases, the relationships become more complicated to store and query.</p>

		<p>Today, I am happy to announce our plans to open a new AWS Region in Spain in late 2022 or early 2023! I'm excited by the opportunities the availability of hyper scale infrastructure will bring to Spanish organizations of all sizes. When the AWS Europe (Spain) Region is launched, developers, startups, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and non-profit organizations will be able to run their applications and serve end users across the region from data centers located in Spain.</p>
		
		<p>Currently, AWS provides 69 Availability Zones across 22 infrastructure regions worldwide, with announced plans for thirteen more Availability Zones and four more Regions in Indonesia, Italy, South Africa, and Spain in the next few years. The new AWS Europe (Spain)Region will consist of three Availability Zones (AZs) at launch, and will be AWS's seventh region in Europe, joining existing regions in Dublin, Frankfurt, London, Paris, Stockholm, and the upcoming Milan region launching in early 2020. AZs refer to data centers in separate distinct locations within a single Region that are engineered to be operationally independent of other AZs, with independent power, cooling, physical security, and are connected via a low latency network. AWS customers focused on running highly available applications can architect their applications to run in multiple AZs to achieve even higher fault-tolerance.</p>
		
		<p>Today is another milestone for us in Spain. This Region adds to other investments we have been making, over the past years, to provide customers with advanced and secure cloud technologies.</p>

		<p>A few days ago I was fortunate to pick up a copy of a book that had a
		major impact on my early career as kernel engineer;</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		  <p><em>The Design and Implementation of the 4.3 BSD UNIX Operating System by
		Samuel J. Leffler, Marshall Kirk McKusick, Michael J. Karels and John
		S. Quarterman</em>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>It was the first authoritative description of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">Berkeley
		UNIX</a>, its
		design and implementation. The book covers the internal structure of the
		4.3 BSD systems and the concepts, data structures and algorithms used in
		implementing the system facilities. But most importantly it was written
		by practitioners and builders and as such gave insights that academic
		text book would never give you.</p>
		
		<p>In those days I was doing an internship at
		<a href="https://www.nikhef.nl/">NIKHEF</a> who were still using a collection of
		PDP 11s and one of my tasks was to get BSD2.9 to run on them. Lots of
		late nights and head scratching, but got it done eventually. I did learn
		how to boot from tape, over and over again (Zen!!). When I returned to
		school, they were about to decommission a PDP 11. I convinced them to
		put it in a old (big) cleaning closet, upgrade the power to the room,
		and I went right back to building out my BSD kernel expertise. I started
		late at Computer Science (28) but worked hard to catch up by getting my
		hands dirty.</p>
		
		<p>When I posted on twitter I found of the book, many of our peers came up
		with a list of other books I had also read from that era.</p>

		<p>One of the most rewarding parts of my job is getting to watch different
		industries implement new technologies that improve and transform
		business operations. Manufacturing, in particular, has always captivated
		my attention in this respect. When I think about how Amazon’s globally
		connected distribution network has changed in the last decade alone,
		it’s incredible. From the Internet of Things (IoT) to Artificial
		Intelligence (AI) and task automation to predictive maintenance
		technology, the advancements in this space are creating a world of new
		opportunity.</p>
		
		<p>But this is complicated by that fact that many manufacturers have been
		around for decades or longer. Some of their equipment was designed
		before the internet even existed. If replacing this equipment isn’t an
		option, how do these manufacturers begin their journey to modern
		manufacturing? The choice of what to embrace and where to start can be
		daunting.</p>
		
		<p>Ultimately, the reason for adopting any new technology in manufacturing
		is usually to achieve one or more of the following objectives: produce
		more, increase safety, or increase quality—and all at a lower cost.
		The good news is that the most important thing a manufacturer needs to
		accomplish with any of these objectives is something they already have.
		It’s something they’ve had since the moment they opened their doors,
		whether that was yesterday or 100 years ago: data.</p>

		<p>On March 16, 2020, at 9:26 PM, I received an urgent email from my friend
		DJ Patil, former White House Chief Data Scientist, Head of Technology
		for Devoted Health, a Senior Fellow at the Belfer Center at the Harvard
		Kennedy School, and Advisor to Venrock Partners. You don’t get that many
		titles after your name unless you’re pretty good at something. For DJ,
		that “something” is math and computer science.</p>
		
		<p>DJ was writing to me from the California crisis command center. He
		explained that he was working with governors from across the country to
		model the potential impact of COVID-19 for scenario planning. He wanted
		to help them answer critical questions, like “How many hospital beds
		will we need?” and “Can we reduce the spread if we temporarily close
		places where people gather?” and “Should we issue a shelter-in-place
		order and for how long?” While nobody can predict the future, modeling
		the virus with all the factors they <em>did know</em> was their best shot at
		helping leaders make informed decisions, which would impact hundreds of
		thousands of lives.</p>

		<p>Back when Jeff Bezos filled orders in his garage and drove packages to the post office himself, crunching the numbers on costs, tracking inventory, and forecasting future demand was relatively simple. Fast-forward 25 years, Amazon's retail business has more than 175 <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/amazon-fulfillment/our-fulfillment-centers/">fulfillment centers</a> (FC) worldwide with over 250,000 full-time associates shipping millions of items per day.</p>
		
		<p>Amazon's worldwide financial operations team has the incredible task of tracking all of that data (think petabytes).  At Amazon's scale, a miscalculated metric, like cost per unit, or delayed data can have a huge impact (think millions of dollars). The team is constantly looking for ways to get more accurate data, faster.</p>
		
		<p>That's why, in 2019, they had an idea: Build a data lake that can support one of the largest logistics networks on the planet. It would later become known internally as the Galaxy data lake. The Galaxy data lake was built in 2019 and now all the various teams are working on moving their data into it.</p>
		
		<p>A data lake is a centralized secure repository that allows you to store, govern, discover, and share all of your structured and unstructured data at any scale. Data lakes don't require a pre-defined schema, so you can process raw data without having to know what insights you might want to explore in the future. The following figure shows the key components of a data lake.</p>

		<p>Have you ever received a call from your bank because they suspected fraudulent activity? Most banks can automatically identify when spending patterns or locations have deviated from the norm and then act immediately. Many times, this happens before victims even noticed that something was off.  As a result, the impact of identity theft on a person's bank account and life can be managed before it's even an issue.</p>
		
		<p>Having a deep understanding of the relationships in your data is powerful like that.</p>
		
		<p>Consider the relationships between diseases and gene interactions. By understanding these connections, you can search for patterns within protein pathways to find other genes that may be associated with a disease. This kind of information could help advance disease research.</p>
		
		<p>The deeper the understanding of the relationships, the more powerful the insights. With enough relationship data points, you can even make predictions about the future (like with a recommendation engine). But as more data is connected, and the size and complexity of the connected data increases, the relationships become more complicated to store and query.</p>

		<p>Today, I am happy to announce our plans to open a new AWS Region in Spain in late 2022 or early 2023! I'm excited by the opportunities the availability of hyper scale infrastructure will bring to Spanish organizations of all sizes. When the AWS Europe (Spain) Region is launched, developers, startups, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and non-profit organizations will be able to run their applications and serve end users across the region from data centers located in Spain.</p>
		
		<p>Currently, AWS provides 69 Availability Zones across 22 infrastructure regions worldwide, with announced plans for thirteen more Availability Zones and four more Regions in Indonesia, Italy, South Africa, and Spain in the next few years. The new AWS Europe (Spain)Region will consist of three Availability Zones (AZs) at launch, and will be AWS's seventh region in Europe, joining existing regions in Dublin, Frankfurt, London, Paris, Stockholm, and the upcoming Milan region launching in early 2020. AZs refer to data centers in separate distinct locations within a single Region that are engineered to be operationally independent of other AZs, with independent power, cooling, physical security, and are connected via a low latency network. AWS customers focused on running highly available applications can architect their applications to run in multiple AZs to achieve even higher fault-tolerance.</p>
		
		<p>Today is another milestone for us in Spain. This Region adds to other investments we have been making, over the past years, to provide customers with advanced and secure cloud technologies.</p>

		<p>A few days ago I was fortunate to pick up a copy of a book that had a
		major impact on my early career as kernel engineer;</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		  <p><em>The Design and Implementation of the 4.3 BSD UNIX Operating System by
		Samuel J. Leffler, Marshall Kirk McKusick, Michael J. Karels and John
		S. Quarterman</em>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>It was the first authoritative description of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">Berkeley
		UNIX</a>, its
		design and implementation. The book covers the internal structure of the
		4.3 BSD systems and the concepts, data structures and algorithms used in
		implementing the system facilities. But most importantly it was written
		by practitioners and builders and as such gave insights that academic
		text book would never give you.</p>
		
		<p>In those days I was doing an internship at
		<a href="https://www.nikhef.nl/">NIKHEF</a> who were still using a collection of
		PDP 11s and one of my tasks was to get BSD2.9 to run on them. Lots of
		late nights and head scratching, but got it done eventually. I did learn
		how to boot from tape, over and over again (Zen!!). When I returned to
		school, they were about to decommission a PDP 11. I convinced them to
		put it in a old (big) cleaning closet, upgrade the power to the room,
		and I went right back to building out my BSD kernel expertise. I started
		late at Computer Science (28) but worked hard to catch up by getting my
		hands dirty.</p>
		
		<p>When I posted on twitter I found of the book, many of our peers came up
		with a list of other books I had also read from that era.</p>

		<p>One of the most rewarding parts of my job is getting to watch different
		industries implement new technologies that improve and transform
		business operations. Manufacturing, in particular, has always captivated
		my attention in this respect. When I think about how Amazon’s globally
		connected distribution network has changed in the last decade alone,
		it’s incredible. From the Internet of Things (IoT) to Artificial
		Intelligence (AI) and task automation to predictive maintenance
		technology, the advancements in this space are creating a world of new
		opportunity.</p>
		
		<p>But this is complicated by that fact that many manufacturers have been
		around for decades or longer. Some of their equipment was designed
		before the internet even existed. If replacing this equipment isn’t an
		option, how do these manufacturers begin their journey to modern
		manufacturing? The choice of what to embrace and where to start can be
		daunting.</p>
		
		<p>Ultimately, the reason for adopting any new technology in manufacturing
		is usually to achieve one or more of the following objectives: produce
		more, increase safety, or increase quality—and all at a lower cost.
		The good news is that the most important thing a manufacturer needs to
		accomplish with any of these objectives is something they already have.
		It’s something they’ve had since the moment they opened their doors,
		whether that was yesterday or 100 years ago: data.</p>

		<p>Have you ever received a call from your bank because they suspected fraudulent activity? Most banks can automatically identify when spending patterns or locations have deviated from the norm and then act immediately. Many times, this happens before victims even noticed that something was off.  As a result, the impact of identity theft on a person's bank account and life can be managed before it's even an issue.</p>
		
		<p>Having a deep understanding of the relationships in your data is powerful like that.</p>
		
		<p>Consider the relationships between diseases and gene interactions. By understanding these connections, you can search for patterns within protein pathways to find other genes that may be associated with a disease. This kind of information could help advance disease research.</p>
		
		<p>The deeper the understanding of the relationships, the more powerful the insights. With enough relationship data points, you can even make predictions about the future (like with a recommendation engine). But as more data is connected, and the size and complexity of the connected data increases, the relationships become more complicated to store and query.</p>

		<p>Today, I am happy to announce our plans to open a new AWS Region in Spain in late 2022 or early 2023! I'm excited by the opportunities the availability of hyper scale infrastructure will bring to Spanish organizations of all sizes. When the AWS Europe (Spain) Region is launched, developers, startups, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and non-profit organizations will be able to run their applications and serve end users across the region from data centers located in Spain.</p>
		
		<p>Currently, AWS provides 69 Availability Zones across 22 infrastructure regions worldwide, with announced plans for thirteen more Availability Zones and four more Regions in Indonesia, Italy, South Africa, and Spain in the next few years. The new AWS Europe (Spain)Region will consist of three Availability Zones (AZs) at launch, and will be AWS's seventh region in Europe, joining existing regions in Dublin, Frankfurt, London, Paris, Stockholm, and the upcoming Milan region launching in early 2020. AZs refer to data centers in separate distinct locations within a single Region that are engineered to be operationally independent of other AZs, with independent power, cooling, physical security, and are connected via a low latency network. AWS customers focused on running highly available applications can architect their applications to run in multiple AZs to achieve even higher fault-tolerance.</p>
		
		<p>Today is another milestone for us in Spain. This Region adds to other investments we have been making, over the past years, to provide customers with advanced and secure cloud technologies.</p>

		<p>A few days ago I was fortunate to pick up a copy of a book that had a
		major impact on my early career as kernel engineer;</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		  <p><em>The Design and Implementation of the 4.3 BSD UNIX Operating System by
		Samuel J. Leffler, Marshall Kirk McKusick, Michael J. Karels and John
		S. Quarterman</em>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>It was the first authoritative description of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">Berkeley
		UNIX</a>, its
		design and implementation. The book covers the internal structure of the
		4.3 BSD systems and the concepts, data structures and algorithms used in
		implementing the system facilities. But most importantly it was written
		by practitioners and builders and as such gave insights that academic
		text book would never give you.</p>
		
		<p>In those days I was doing an internship at
		<a href="https://www.nikhef.nl/">NIKHEF</a> who were still using a collection of
		PDP 11s and one of my tasks was to get BSD2.9 to run on them. Lots of
		late nights and head scratching, but got it done eventually. I did learn
		how to boot from tape, over and over again (Zen!!). When I returned to
		school, they were about to decommission a PDP 11. I convinced them to
		put it in a old (big) cleaning closet, upgrade the power to the room,
		and I went right back to building out my BSD kernel expertise. I started
		late at Computer Science (28) but worked hard to catch up by getting my
		hands dirty.</p>
		
		<p>When I posted on twitter I found of the book, many of our peers came up
		with a list of other books I had also read from that era.</p>

		<p>One of the most rewarding parts of my job is getting to watch different
		industries implement new technologies that improve and transform
		business operations. Manufacturing, in particular, has always captivated
		my attention in this respect. When I think about how Amazon’s globally
		connected distribution network has changed in the last decade alone,
		it’s incredible. From the Internet of Things (IoT) to Artificial
		Intelligence (AI) and task automation to predictive maintenance
		technology, the advancements in this space are creating a world of new
		opportunity.</p>
		
		<p>But this is complicated by that fact that many manufacturers have been
		around for decades or longer. Some of their equipment was designed
		before the internet even existed. If replacing this equipment isn’t an
		option, how do these manufacturers begin their journey to modern
		manufacturing? The choice of what to embrace and where to start can be
		daunting.</p>
		
		<p>Ultimately, the reason for adopting any new technology in manufacturing
		is usually to achieve one or more of the following objectives: produce
		more, increase safety, or increase quality—and all at a lower cost.
		The good news is that the most important thing a manufacturer needs to
		accomplish with any of these objectives is something they already have.
		It’s something they’ve had since the moment they opened their doors,
		whether that was yesterday or 100 years ago: data.</p>

		<p>On March 16, 2020, at 9:26 PM, I received an urgent email from my friend
		DJ Patil, former White House Chief Data Scientist, Head of Technology
		for Devoted Health, a Senior Fellow at the Belfer Center at the Harvard
		Kennedy School, and Advisor to Venrock Partners. You don’t get that many
		titles after your name unless you’re pretty good at something. For DJ,
		that “something” is math and computer science.</p>
		
		<p>DJ was writing to me from the California crisis command center. He
		explained that he was working with governors from across the country to
		model the potential impact of COVID-19 for scenario planning. He wanted
		to help them answer critical questions, like “How many hospital beds
		will we need?” and “Can we reduce the spread if we temporarily close
		places where people gather?” and “Should we issue a shelter-in-place
		order and for how long?” While nobody can predict the future, modeling
		the virus with all the factors they <em>did know</em> was their best shot at
		helping leaders make informed decisions, which would impact hundreds of
		thousands of lives.</p>

		<p>Back when Jeff Bezos filled orders in his garage and drove packages to the post office himself, crunching the numbers on costs, tracking inventory, and forecasting future demand was relatively simple. Fast-forward 25 years, Amazon's retail business has more than 175 <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/amazon-fulfillment/our-fulfillment-centers/">fulfillment centers</a> (FC) worldwide with over 250,000 full-time associates shipping millions of items per day.</p>
		
		<p>Amazon's worldwide financial operations team has the incredible task of tracking all of that data (think petabytes).  At Amazon's scale, a miscalculated metric, like cost per unit, or delayed data can have a huge impact (think millions of dollars). The team is constantly looking for ways to get more accurate data, faster.</p>
		
		<p>That's why, in 2019, they had an idea: Build a data lake that can support one of the largest logistics networks on the planet. It would later become known internally as the Galaxy data lake. The Galaxy data lake was built in 2019 and now all the various teams are working on moving their data into it.</p>
		
		<p>A data lake is a centralized secure repository that allows you to store, govern, discover, and share all of your structured and unstructured data at any scale. Data lakes don't require a pre-defined schema, so you can process raw data without having to know what insights you might want to explore in the future. The following figure shows the key components of a data lake.</p>

		<p>During AWS re:Invent 2019, we announced a number of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/">High Performance Computing (HPC)</a> innovations including the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/12/announcing-new-amazon-ec2-m6g-c6g-and-r6g-instances-powered-by-next-generation-arm-based-aws-graviton2-processors/">Amazon EC2 M6g, C6g, and R6g instances</a> powered by next-generation Arm-based AWS Graviton2 Processors. We also recently announced that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-new-amd-powered-compute-optimized-ec2-instances-c5a-c5ad/">new AMD-powered, compute-optimized EC2 instances</a> are in the works.</p>
		
		<p>Today, I'm happy to share some exciting news about our HPC solutions. On November 18, AWS won six <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/hpcwire-reveals-winners-of-the-2019-readers-and-editors-choice-awards-at-sc19-conference-in-denver-co/">HPCwire Readers' and Editors' Choice Awards</a> at SC19, the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis.</p>

		<p>Today, I am happy to announce our plans to open a new AWS Region in Spain in late 2022 or early 2023! I'm excited by the opportunities the availability of hyper scale infrastructure will bring to Spanish organizations of all sizes. When the AWS Europe (Spain) Region is launched, developers, startups, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and non-profit organizations will be able to run their applications and serve end users across the region from data centers located in Spain.</p>
		
		<p>Currently, AWS provides 69 Availability Zones across 22 infrastructure regions worldwide, with announced plans for thirteen more Availability Zones and four more Regions in Indonesia, Italy, South Africa, and Spain in the next few years. The new AWS Europe (Spain)Region will consist of three Availability Zones (AZs) at launch, and will be AWS's seventh region in Europe, joining existing regions in Dublin, Frankfurt, London, Paris, Stockholm, and the upcoming Milan region launching in early 2020. AZs refer to data centers in separate distinct locations within a single Region that are engineered to be operationally independent of other AZs, with independent power, cooling, physical security, and are connected via a low latency network. AWS customers focused on running highly available applications can architect their applications to run in multiple AZs to achieve even higher fault-tolerance.</p>
		
		<p>Today is another milestone for us in Spain. This Region adds to other investments we have been making, over the past years, to provide customers with advanced and secure cloud technologies.</p>

		<p>A few days ago I was fortunate to pick up a copy of a book that had a
		major impact on my early career as kernel engineer;</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		  <p><em>The Design and Implementation of the 4.3 BSD UNIX Operating System by
		Samuel J. Leffler, Marshall Kirk McKusick, Michael J. Karels and John
		S. Quarterman</em>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>It was the first authoritative description of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">Berkeley
		UNIX</a>, its
		design and implementation. The book covers the internal structure of the
		4.3 BSD systems and the concepts, data structures and algorithms used in
		implementing the system facilities. But most importantly it was written
		by practitioners and builders and as such gave insights that academic
		text book would never give you.</p>
		
		<p>In those days I was doing an internship at
		<a href="https://www.nikhef.nl/">NIKHEF</a> who were still using a collection of
		PDP 11s and one of my tasks was to get BSD2.9 to run on them. Lots of
		late nights and head scratching, but got it done eventually. I did learn
		how to boot from tape, over and over again (Zen!!). When I returned to
		school, they were about to decommission a PDP 11. I convinced them to
		put it in a old (big) cleaning closet, upgrade the power to the room,
		and I went right back to building out my BSD kernel expertise. I started
		late at Computer Science (28) but worked hard to catch up by getting my
		hands dirty.</p>
		
		<p>When I posted on twitter I found of the book, many of our peers came up
		with a list of other books I had also read from that era.</p>

		<p>One of the most rewarding parts of my job is getting to watch different
		industries implement new technologies that improve and transform
		business operations. Manufacturing, in particular, has always captivated
		my attention in this respect. When I think about how Amazon’s globally
		connected distribution network has changed in the last decade alone,
		it’s incredible. From the Internet of Things (IoT) to Artificial
		Intelligence (AI) and task automation to predictive maintenance
		technology, the advancements in this space are creating a world of new
		opportunity.</p>
		
		<p>But this is complicated by that fact that many manufacturers have been
		around for decades or longer. Some of their equipment was designed
		before the internet even existed. If replacing this equipment isn’t an
		option, how do these manufacturers begin their journey to modern
		manufacturing? The choice of what to embrace and where to start can be
		daunting.</p>
		
		<p>Ultimately, the reason for adopting any new technology in manufacturing
		is usually to achieve one or more of the following objectives: produce
		more, increase safety, or increase quality—and all at a lower cost.
		The good news is that the most important thing a manufacturer needs to
		accomplish with any of these objectives is something they already have.
		It’s something they’ve had since the moment they opened their doors,
		whether that was yesterday or 100 years ago: data.</p>

		<p>On March 16, 2020, at 9:26 PM, I received an urgent email from my friend
		DJ Patil, former White House Chief Data Scientist, Head of Technology
		for Devoted Health, a Senior Fellow at the Belfer Center at the Harvard
		Kennedy School, and Advisor to Venrock Partners. You don’t get that many
		titles after your name unless you’re pretty good at something. For DJ,
		that “something” is math and computer science.</p>
		
		<p>DJ was writing to me from the California crisis command center. He
		explained that he was working with governors from across the country to
		model the potential impact of COVID-19 for scenario planning. He wanted
		to help them answer critical questions, like “How many hospital beds
		will we need?” and “Can we reduce the spread if we temporarily close
		places where people gather?” and “Should we issue a shelter-in-place
		order and for how long?” While nobody can predict the future, modeling
		the virus with all the factors they <em>did know</em> was their best shot at
		helping leaders make informed decisions, which would impact hundreds of
		thousands of lives.</p>

		<p>Back when Jeff Bezos filled orders in his garage and drove packages to the post office himself, crunching the numbers on costs, tracking inventory, and forecasting future demand was relatively simple. Fast-forward 25 years, Amazon's retail business has more than 175 <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/amazon-fulfillment/our-fulfillment-centers/">fulfillment centers</a> (FC) worldwide with over 250,000 full-time associates shipping millions of items per day.</p>
		
		<p>Amazon's worldwide financial operations team has the incredible task of tracking all of that data (think petabytes).  At Amazon's scale, a miscalculated metric, like cost per unit, or delayed data can have a huge impact (think millions of dollars). The team is constantly looking for ways to get more accurate data, faster.</p>
		
		<p>That's why, in 2019, they had an idea: Build a data lake that can support one of the largest logistics networks on the planet. It would later become known internally as the Galaxy data lake. The Galaxy data lake was built in 2019 and now all the various teams are working on moving their data into it.</p>
		
		<p>A data lake is a centralized secure repository that allows you to store, govern, discover, and share all of your structured and unstructured data at any scale. Data lakes don't require a pre-defined schema, so you can process raw data without having to know what insights you might want to explore in the future. The following figure shows the key components of a data lake.</p>

		<p>Have you ever received a call from your bank because they suspected fraudulent activity? Most banks can automatically identify when spending patterns or locations have deviated from the norm and then act immediately. Many times, this happens before victims even noticed that something was off.  As a result, the impact of identity theft on a person's bank account and life can be managed before it's even an issue.</p>
		
		<p>Having a deep understanding of the relationships in your data is powerful like that.</p>
		
		<p>Consider the relationships between diseases and gene interactions. By understanding these connections, you can search for patterns within protein pathways to find other genes that may be associated with a disease. This kind of information could help advance disease research.</p>
		
		<p>The deeper the understanding of the relationships, the more powerful the insights. With enough relationship data points, you can even make predictions about the future (like with a recommendation engine). But as more data is connected, and the size and complexity of the connected data increases, the relationships become more complicated to store and query.</p>

		<p>During AWS re:Invent 2019, we announced a number of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/">High Performance Computing (HPC)</a> innovations including the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/12/announcing-new-amazon-ec2-m6g-c6g-and-r6g-instances-powered-by-next-generation-arm-based-aws-graviton2-processors/">Amazon EC2 M6g, C6g, and R6g instances</a> powered by next-generation Arm-based AWS Graviton2 Processors. We also recently announced that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-new-amd-powered-compute-optimized-ec2-instances-c5a-c5ad/">new AMD-powered, compute-optimized EC2 instances</a> are in the works.</p>
		
		<p>Today, I'm happy to share some exciting news about our HPC solutions. On November 18, AWS won six <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/hpcwire-reveals-winners-of-the-2019-readers-and-editors-choice-awards-at-sc19-conference-in-denver-co/">HPCwire Readers' and Editors' Choice Awards</a> at SC19, the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis.</p>

		<p>Today, I am happy to announce our plans to open a new AWS Region in Spain in late 2022 or early 2023! I'm excited by the opportunities the availability of hyper scale infrastructure will bring to Spanish organizations of all sizes. When the AWS Europe (Spain) Region is launched, developers, startups, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and non-profit organizations will be able to run their applications and serve end users across the region from data centers located in Spain.</p>
		
		<p>Currently, AWS provides 69 Availability Zones across 22 infrastructure regions worldwide, with announced plans for thirteen more Availability Zones and four more Regions in Indonesia, Italy, South Africa, and Spain in the next few years. The new AWS Europe (Spain)Region will consist of three Availability Zones (AZs) at launch, and will be AWS's seventh region in Europe, joining existing regions in Dublin, Frankfurt, London, Paris, Stockholm, and the upcoming Milan region launching in early 2020. AZs refer to data centers in separate distinct locations within a single Region that are engineered to be operationally independent of other AZs, with independent power, cooling, physical security, and are connected via a low latency network. AWS customers focused on running highly available applications can architect their applications to run in multiple AZs to achieve even higher fault-tolerance.</p>
		
		<p>Today is another milestone for us in Spain. This Region adds to other investments we have been making, over the past years, to provide customers with advanced and secure cloud technologies.</p>

		<p>A few days ago I was fortunate to pick up a copy of a book that had a
		major impact on my early career as kernel engineer;</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		  <p><em>The Design and Implementation of the 4.3 BSD UNIX Operating System by
		Samuel J. Leffler, Marshall Kirk McKusick, Michael J. Karels and John
		S. Quarterman</em>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>It was the first authoritative description of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">Berkeley
		UNIX</a>, its
		design and implementation. The book covers the internal structure of the
		4.3 BSD systems and the concepts, data structures and algorithms used in
		implementing the system facilities. But most importantly it was written
		by practitioners and builders and as such gave insights that academic
		text book would never give you.</p>
		
		<p>In those days I was doing an internship at
		<a href="https://www.nikhef.nl/">NIKHEF</a> who were still using a collection of
		PDP 11s and one of my tasks was to get BSD2.9 to run on them. Lots of
		late nights and head scratching, but got it done eventually. I did learn
		how to boot from tape, over and over again (Zen!!). When I returned to
		school, they were about to decommission a PDP 11. I convinced them to
		put it in a old (big) cleaning closet, upgrade the power to the room,
		and I went right back to building out my BSD kernel expertise. I started
		late at Computer Science (28) but worked hard to catch up by getting my
		hands dirty.</p>
		
		<p>When I posted on twitter I found of the book, many of our peers came up
		with a list of other books I had also read from that era.</p>

		<p>One of the most rewarding parts of my job is getting to watch different
		industries implement new technologies that improve and transform
		business operations. Manufacturing, in particular, has always captivated
		my attention in this respect. When I think about how Amazon’s globally
		connected distribution network has changed in the last decade alone,
		it’s incredible. From the Internet of Things (IoT) to Artificial
		Intelligence (AI) and task automation to predictive maintenance
		technology, the advancements in this space are creating a world of new
		opportunity.</p>
		
		<p>But this is complicated by that fact that many manufacturers have been
		around for decades or longer. Some of their equipment was designed
		before the internet even existed. If replacing this equipment isn’t an
		option, how do these manufacturers begin their journey to modern
		manufacturing? The choice of what to embrace and where to start can be
		daunting.</p>
		
		<p>Ultimately, the reason for adopting any new technology in manufacturing
		is usually to achieve one or more of the following objectives: produce
		more, increase safety, or increase quality—and all at a lower cost.
		The good news is that the most important thing a manufacturer needs to
		accomplish with any of these objectives is something they already have.
		It’s something they’ve had since the moment they opened their doors,
		whether that was yesterday or 100 years ago: data.</p>

		<p>The global healthcare pandemic has been like nothing many of us in

		<p>On March 16, 2020, at 9:26 PM, I received an urgent email from my friend
		DJ Patil, former White House Chief Data Scientist, Head of Technology
		for Devoted Health, a Senior Fellow at the Belfer Center at the Harvard
		Kennedy School, and Advisor to Venrock Partners. You don’t get that many
		titles after your name unless you’re pretty good at something. For DJ,
		that “something” is math and computer science.</p>
		
		<p>DJ was writing to me from the California crisis command center. He
		explained that he was working with governors from across the country to
		model the potential impact of COVID-19 for scenario planning. He wanted
		to help them answer critical questions, like “How many hospital beds
		will we need?” and “Can we reduce the spread if we temporarily close
		places where people gather?” and “Should we issue a shelter-in-place
		order and for how long?” While nobody can predict the future, modeling
		the virus with all the factors they <em>did know</em> was their best shot at
		helping leaders make informed decisions, which would impact hundreds of
		thousands of lives.</p>

		<p>Back when Jeff Bezos filled orders in his garage and drove packages to the post office himself, crunching the numbers on costs, tracking inventory, and forecasting future demand was relatively simple. Fast-forward 25 years, Amazon's retail business has more than 175 <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/amazon-fulfillment/our-fulfillment-centers/">fulfillment centers</a> (FC) worldwide with over 250,000 full-time associates shipping millions of items per day.</p>
		
		<p>Amazon's worldwide financial operations team has the incredible task of tracking all of that data (think petabytes).  At Amazon's scale, a miscalculated metric, like cost per unit, or delayed data can have a huge impact (think millions of dollars). The team is constantly looking for ways to get more accurate data, faster.</p>
		
		<p>That's why, in 2019, they had an idea: Build a data lake that can support one of the largest logistics networks on the planet. It would later become known internally as the Galaxy data lake. The Galaxy data lake was built in 2019 and now all the various teams are working on moving their data into it.</p>
		
		<p>A data lake is a centralized secure repository that allows you to store, govern, discover, and share all of your structured and unstructured data at any scale. Data lakes don't require a pre-defined schema, so you can process raw data without having to know what insights you might want to explore in the future. The following figure shows the key components of a data lake.</p>

		<p>Have you ever received a call from your bank because they suspected fraudulent activity? Most banks can automatically identify when spending patterns or locations have deviated from the norm and then act immediately. Many times, this happens before victims even noticed that something was off.  As a result, the impact of identity theft on a person's bank account and life can be managed before it's even an issue.</p>
		
		<p>Having a deep understanding of the relationships in your data is powerful like that.</p>
		
		<p>Consider the relationships between diseases and gene interactions. By understanding these connections, you can search for patterns within protein pathways to find other genes that may be associated with a disease. This kind of information could help advance disease research.</p>
		
		<p>The deeper the understanding of the relationships, the more powerful the insights. With enough relationship data points, you can even make predictions about the future (like with a recommendation engine). But as more data is connected, and the size and complexity of the connected data increases, the relationships become more complicated to store and query.</p>

We also recently announced that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-new-amd-powered-compute-optimized-ec2-instances-c5a-c5ad/">new AMD-powered, compute-optimized EC2 instances</a> are in the works.</p>
		
		<p>Today, I'm happy to share some exciting news about our HPC solutions. On November 18, AWS won six <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/hpcwire-reveals-winners-of-the-2019-readers-and-editors-choice-awards-at-sc19-conference-in-denver-co/">HPCwire Readers' and Editors' Choice Awards</a> at SC19, the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis.</p>

		<p>Today, I am happy to announce our plans to open a new AWS Region in Spain in late 2022 or early 2023! I'm excited by the opportunities the availability of hyper scale infrastructure will bring to Spanish organizations of all sizes. When the AWS Europe (Spain) Region is launched, developers, startups, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and non-profit organizations will be able to run their applications and serve end users across the region from data centers located in Spain.</p>
		
		<p>Currently, AWS provides 69 Availability Zones across 22 infrastructure regions worldwide, with announced plans for thirteen more Availability Zones and four more Regions in Indonesia, Italy, South Africa, and Spain in the next few years. The new AWS Europe (Spain)Region will consist of three Availability Zones (AZs) at launch, and will be AWS's seventh region in Europe, joining existing regions in Dublin, Frankfurt, London, Paris, Stockholm, and the upcoming Milan region launching in early 2020. AZs refer to data centers in separate distinct locations within a single Region that are engineered to be operationally independent of other AZs, with independent power, cooling, physical security, and are connected via a low latency network. AWS customers focused on running highly available applications can architect their applications to run in multiple AZs to achieve even higher fault-tolerance.</p>
		
		<p>Today is another milestone for us in Spain. This Region adds to other investments we have been making, over the past years, to provide customers with advanced and secure cloud technologies.</p>

		<p>A few days ago I was fortunate to pick up a copy of a book that had a
		major impact on my early career as kernel engineer;</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		  <p><em>The Design and Implementation of the 4.3 BSD UNIX Operating System by
		Samuel J. Leffler, Marshall Kirk McKusick, Michael J. Karels and John
		S. Quarterman</em>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>It was the first authoritative description of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">Berkeley
		UNIX</a>, its
		design and implementation. The book covers the internal structure of the
		4.3 BSD systems and the concepts, data structures and algorithms used in
		implementing the system facilities. But most importantly it was written
		by practitioners and builders and as such gave insights that academic
		text book would never give you.</p>
		
		<p>In those days I was doing an internship at
		<a href="https://www.nikhef.nl/">NIKHEF</a> who were still using a collection of
		PDP 11s and one of my tasks was to get BSD2.9 to run on them. Lots of
		late nights and head scratching, but got it done eventually. I did learn
		how to boot from tape, over and over again (Zen!!). When I returned to
		school, they were about to decommission a PDP 11. I convinced them to
		put it in a old (big) cleaning closet, upgrade the power to the room,
		and I went right back to building out my BSD kernel expertise. I started
		late at Computer Science (28) but worked hard to catch up by getting my
		hands dirty.</p>
		
		<p>When I posted on twitter I found of the book, many of our peers came up
		with a list of other books I had also read from that era.</p>

		<p>One of the most rewarding parts of my job is getting to watch different
		industries implement new technologies that improve and transform
		business operations. Manufacturing, in particular, has always captivated
		my attention in this respect. When I think about how Amazon’s globally
		connected distribution network has changed in the last decade alone,
		it’s incredible. From the Internet of Things (IoT) to Artificial
		Intelligence (AI) and task automation to predictive maintenance
		technology, the advancements in this space are creating a world of new
		opportunity.</p>
		
		<p>But this is complicated by that fact that many manufacturers have been
		around for decades or longer. Some of their equipment was designed
		before the internet even existed. If replacing this equipment isn’t an
		option, how do these manufacturers begin their journey to modern
		manufacturing? The choice of what to embrace and where to start can be
		daunting.</p>
		
		<p>Ultimately, the reason for adopting any new technology in manufacturing
		is usually to achieve one or more of the following objectives: produce
		more, increase safety, or increase quality—and all at a lower cost.
		The good news is that the most important thing a manufacturer needs to
		accomplish with any of these objectives is something they already have.
		It’s something they’ve had since the moment they opened their doors,
		whether that was yesterday or 100 years ago: data.</p>

		<p>The global healthcare pandemic has been like nothing many of us in

		at Amazon Web Services (AWS). We are focused on where we can make the

		<p>On March 16, 2020, at 9:26 PM, I received an urgent email from my friend
		DJ Patil, former White House Chief Data Scientist, Head of Technology
		for Devoted Health, a Senior Fellow at the Belfer Center at the Harvard
		Kennedy School, and Advisor to Venrock Partners. You don’t get that many
		titles after your name unless you’re pretty good at something. For DJ,
		that “something” is math and computer science.</p>
		
		<p>DJ was writing to me from the California crisis command center. He
		explained that he was working with governors from across the country to
		model the potential impact of COVID-19 for scenario planning. He wanted
		to help them answer critical questions, like “How many hospital beds
		will we need?” and “Can we reduce the spread if we temporarily close
		places where people gather?” and “Should we issue a shelter-in-place
		order and for how long?” While nobody can predict the future, modeling
		the virus with all the factors they <em>did know</em> was their best shot at
		helping leaders make informed decisions, which would impact hundreds of
		thousands of lives.</p>

		<p>Back when Jeff Bezos filled orders in his garage and drove packages to the post office himself, crunching the numbers on costs, tracking inventory, and forecasting future demand was relatively simple. Fast-forward 25 years, Amazon's retail business has more than 175 <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/amazon-fulfillment/our-fulfillment-centers/">fulfillment centers</a> (FC) worldwide with over 250,000 full-time associates shipping millions of items per day.</p>
		
		<p>Amazon's worldwide financial operations team has the incredible task of tracking all of that data (think petabytes).  At Amazon's scale, a miscalculated metric, like cost per unit, or delayed data can have a huge impact (think millions of dollars). The team is constantly looking for ways to get more accurate data, faster.</p>
		
		<p>That's why, in 2019, they had an idea: Build a data lake that can support one of the largest logistics networks on the planet. It would later become known internally as the Galaxy data lake. The Galaxy data lake was built in 2019 and now all the various teams are working on moving their data into it.</p>
		
		<p>A data lake is a centralized secure repository that allows you to store, govern, discover, and share all of your structured and unstructured data at any scale. Data lakes don't require a pre-defined schema, so you can process raw data without having to know what insights you might want to explore in the future. The following figure shows the key components of a data lake.</p>

		<p>Have you ever received a call from your bank because they suspected fraudulent activity? Most banks can automatically identify when spending patterns or locations have deviated from the norm and then act immediately. Many times, this happens before victims even noticed that something was off.  As a result, the impact of identity theft on a person's bank account and life can be managed before it's even an issue.</p>
		
		<p>Having a deep understanding of the relationships in your data is powerful like that.</p>
		
		<p>Consider the relationships between diseases and gene interactions. By understanding these connections, you can search for patterns within protein pathways to find other genes that may be associated with a disease. This kind of information could help advance disease research.</p>
		
		<p>The deeper the understanding of the relationships, the more powerful the insights. With enough relationship data points, you can even make predictions about the future (like with a recommendation engine). But as more data is connected, and the size and complexity of the connected data increases, the relationships become more complicated to store and query.</p>

We also recently announced that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-new-amd-powered-compute-optimized-ec2-instances-c5a-c5ad/">new AMD-powered, compute-optimized EC2 instances</a> are in the works.</p>
		
		<p>Today, I'm happy to share some exciting news about our HPC solutions. On November 18, AWS won six <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/hpcwire-reveals-winners-of-the-2019-readers-and-editors-choice-awards-at-sc19-conference-in-denver-co/">HPCwire Readers' and Editors' Choice Awards</a> at SC19, the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis.</p>

		<p>Today, I am happy to announce our plans to open a new AWS Region in Spain in late 2022 or early 2023! I'm excited by the opportunities the availability of hyper scale infrastructure will bring to Spanish organizations of all sizes. When the AWS Europe (Spain) Region is launched, developers, startups, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and non-profit organizations will be able to run their applications and serve end users across the region from data centers located in Spain.</p>
		
		<p>Currently, AWS provides 69 Availability Zones across 22 infrastructure regions worldwide, with announced plans for thirteen more Availability Zones and four more Regions in Indonesia, Italy, South Africa, and Spain in the next few years. The new AWS Europe (Spain)Region will consist of three Availability Zones (AZs) at launch, and will be AWS's seventh region in Europe, joining existing regions in Dublin, Frankfurt, London, Paris, Stockholm, and the upcoming Milan region launching in early 2020. AZs refer to data centers in separate distinct locations within a single Region that are engineered to be operationally independent of other AZs, with independent power, cooling, physical security, and are connected via a low latency network. AWS customers focused on running highly available applications can architect their applications to run in multiple AZs to achieve even higher fault-tolerance.</p>
		
		<p>Today is another milestone for us in Spain. This Region adds to other investments we have been making, over the past years, to provide customers with advanced and secure cloud technologies.</p>
