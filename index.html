			on Jim Whittaker Wilderness Peak Trail on Cougar Mountain with a buddy, Brent K.  
			Saw the fog sitting on the hills driving over and first lightpeaking over the horizon.

<h1>Zoom and Skype</h1>

<p><img src="static/img/zoom.png" width="450"></p>

		<p><b>26 July 2020</b>:  At one time, Skype was dominant.   Microsoft acquired Skype for <b>$8.5
			billion</b> in 2011.
			Now, Zoom is the new Skype and we're relying on video conferencing more than ever.  Was just curious what happened?
		</p>
		<p>
			Looking into it, Microsoft merged Skype with Lync, its in-house 
			enterprise internet phone service, in order to be packaged under Office.  
			While Microsoft allocated resources to integrating Skype with the rest of its back-end systems, competing
			services like Zoom, What's App, FaceTime, and Houseparty launched and gained
			market share.  In addition, Skype 
			became more difficult to use after it merged under Office.

		<p>
			The LA Times' <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-skype-microsoft-20180511-story.html">
				Don't Skype Me</a> summarizes the issues.

		<p><b>20 July 2020</b>: Saw Hamilton for the first time a few days ago.  I absolutely loved it.  I love that it's about
			getting what you want, making use of the limited time given to us.  It's Lin-Manuel's
			genius to realize Hamilton was the original badass immigrant.  Started from nothing and rose up to
			change history on the biggest scale.  The musical comes full circle for me.  My AP US History teacher, Dr.
			Conlon, whom I am the biggest fan of and who herself is the biggest fan of Alexander Hamilton taught us early on 
			he's the one that kept US credit from becoming worthless by forcing the US to honor it's debts.  It's wonderful that everyone else is celebrating
			this now as well.   
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		  <p><em>Rise up, When you're living on your knees, You Rise up</em>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>The story made me think of my family's personal history. 
			I can never give my parents enough credit for living the American dream.
			My Dad grew up with little but used his mind to test into academic programs for free of charge.
			One thing I love about him is his supreme confidence in his intellect.  And why not?  He pulled himselt
			out of nothing to earn a PhD from UC Berkeley in Electrical Engineering when that program was at its zenith
			of power.  He told me stories how he lived on a few dollars a day.  Rose up early to work part-time jobs 
			like baking bread for a local store at 4:30AM.  His treat every once in a while was a hot dog from Top Dog.
			These are the stories that live with me.  
		</p>

		<p>
			Eventually he used that PhD to cofound his company, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANADIGICS">Anadigics</a>, 
			in 1985.  The Company went public about 10 years later.

		<p><b>04 July 2020</b>: When I first started to race triathlons, I was put off by how spending $
			could get you a better time.  I grew up swimming competitively.  There is nothing
			you can buy that makes you swim faster.  Only hard work in the pool.  It's the same for running.
			I guess that's why both of those sports speak to me. </p>
		<p>As you get up the training curve, you realize the right equipment makes a difference.  Nothing will
			ever replace the engine (that's you) and training hard and smart.  But a beautiful bike will make 
			your rides that much more fun.  The Cervelo P5 is like riding a rocket ship. 
		</p>
		<p>I'm thankful for the small group of workout buddies I share training notes with.  This post goes to
			Adam Guren and Dorje Glassman.

			<p><em>The Days are Just Packed. - Bill Watterson</em>.</p>
		  </blockquote>
		  
		<p><b>27 June 2020</b>: Washington state has some of the most beautiful lakes on this planet.  The best part
			is they are largely untouched gems.  World-class locations you visit by parking along side
			the road.  The water is clear and brisk. You can see small fish swimming around as you wade in.
			This is a picture of <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/232064">Lake Kachess</a>. 
		</p>
		
		<p>I spent the summers of my youth playing with my friends at the local Racquets Club in leafy Short Hills, NJ.  There, I joined
			my first swim team, made my first friends, and learned to do a back dive.  I'm 
			happy Mayson can enjoy his summers too, when the days are long and packed.

		<p><b>20 June 2020</b>: Springsteen is one of those legendary figures.  Half god half man.  One of those in that 
			stratosphere few attain.  I was drawn to his autobiography because I wanted to learn more about the legend.  
			Springsteen's voice is humble and meditative.  As a Jersey boy,
			it's heartening to read about one of New Jersey's true legends.  
		<p>
		This book matters to me because when I left Kindle in 2018 I asked my friends at Simon & Schuster to sign my copy of
		the book.  I had some of my most educational and fun negotiations with the team at S&S.  They are sharp, professional, 
		and a real pleasure.  It is signed Colin Shields, Doug Stambaugh, and Chrissy Festa.

		<p><b>08 June 2020</b>: I could write forever about my mom.   
			She is the one who taught me how to ride a bike, pushed me to go off a high dive for the first time,
			and she is the glue that holds our family together.  When my brother and I grew up, my mom raised us day in and day 
			out by herself.  My dad was busy at work and is naturally hands off day to day.  She cooked for us 
			three meals a day and did the dishes for every meal, washed our laundry, and did all the shopping on her own.  
			Not once did she ask us to help with the chores.  Incredible.

			To this day, the Tiny Toons Adventures musical episode is one of them.
			I watched hours of TV growing up.  This is one of the very best.
			Instantly catchy and entirely original songs paired with fun themes like Arabian Nights.
			Two classics are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulsloBRDFzA">They Might be Giant's "Istanbul (Constantinople)</a>
