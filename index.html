		<p>7/20/20: Saw Hamilton for the first time a few days ago.  I absolutely loved it.  I love that it's about
			getting what you want, making use of the limited time given to us.  It's Lin-Manuel's
			genius to realize Hamilton was the original badass immigrant.  Started from nothing and rose up to
			change history on the biggest scale.  The musical comes full circle for me.  My AP US History teacher, Dr.
			Conlon, whom I am the biggest fan of and who herself is the biggest fan of Alexander Hamilton taught us early on 
			he's the one that kept US credit from becoming worthless by forcing the US to honor it's debts.  It's wonderful that everyone else is celebrating
			this now as well.

		<p>The story made me think of my family's personal history. 
			I can never give my parents enough credit for living the American dream.
			My Dad grew up with little but used his mind to test into academic programs for free of charge.
			One thing I love about him is his supreme confidence in his intellect.  And why not?  He pulled himselt
			out of nothing to earn a PhD from UC Berkeley in Electrical Engineering when that program was at its zenith
			of power.  He told me stories how he lived on a few dollars a day.  Rose up early to work part-time jobs 
			like baking break for a local store at 4:30AM.  His treat every once in a while was a hot dog from Top Dog.
			These are the stories that live with me.  
		</p>

		<p>
			Eventually he used that PhD to cofound his company, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANADIGICS">Anadigics</a>, 
			in 1985.  The Company went public about 10 years later.

						<p>7/04/20: When I first started to race triathlons, I was put off by how spending $
							could get you a better time.  I grew up swimming competitively.  There is nothing
						you can buy that makes you swim faster.  Only hard work in the pool.  It's the same for running.
						I guess that's why both of those sports speak to me. </p>
						<p>As you get up the training curve, you realize the right equipment makes a difference.  Nothing will
							ever replace the engine (that's you) and training hard and smart.  But a beautiful bike will make 
							your rides that much more fun.  The Cervelo P5 is like riding a rocket ship. 
						 </p>
						 <p>I'm thankful for the small group of workout buddies I share training notes with.  This post goes to
							 Adam Guren and Dorje Glassman.

		<p>6/27/20: Washington state has some of the most beautiful lakes on this planet.  The best part
			is they are largely untouched gems.  World-class locations you visit by parking along side
			the road.  The water is clear and brisk. You can see small fish swimming around as you wade in.
			This is a picture of <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/232064">Lake Kachess</a>.

		<p>I spent the summers of my youth playing with my friends at the local Racquets Club.  There, I joined
			my first swim team, made my first friends, and learned to do a back dive.  All magical.  I'm 
			happy Mayson can enjoy his summers too, when the days are long and packed full of things to do.
			I still remember the fireflies that came out at night in our backyard.
