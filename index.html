  <h1>70.3 Ironman Washington</h1>
  
  <p><b>17 September 2021</b>:  Finished my first 70.3!! 
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>Thank you, Sean and Greg</h1>
  
	<p><b>28 August 2021</b>:  Went out on a 50 mile bike ride today.  At about mile 25 and at the furthest point away from the starting point possible, I got a 
		flat tire.  Hadn't brought a repair kit. Oh man.  How foolish of me.  That was trouble because it's difficult to walk in bike shoes, and I was 30 miles away
		from my car.  I tried riding on the flat but that felt dangerous because I was alongside a busy road with cars whooshing by.  
	</p>
	<p>Two riders, Sean and Greg from Raise the Bar triathlon club, saw me walking my bike along and stopped by to help.  They could have easily kept riding past me. 
		Instead they took time out of their ride to help me.  They had a spare tire and offered a tube.  Then they realized
		I didn't have the other equipment needed and replaced my flat for me entirely.  I felt embarrassed and thankful.  So embarrassed that I forgot to get their numbers to thank them
		or return the favor.  Sean and Greg, this post is for you.  It takes a special person to offer help selflessly.  I'm not sure I would have done the same thing, but after today, I will.  
		Special thanks to  you, Sean, for spotting me first.

  <p><b>28 March 2021</b>:  I skiied <a href="https://summitatsnoqualmie.com/alpental" target="_blank">Alpental</a>
	  at least 10 times this season.  For a guy who was happy to ski one or two times a year on the east coast, 
	  this is heaven.  The mountain vistas on I-90 on the way to Snoqualmie Pass are unbelievably beautiful.  
	  It is no small gift to see them.  It's good for the soul.

	<p><b>10 March 2021</b>:  Proud of mounting our new OLED.  Thank you, Lucy, for helping me!  The challenge is
		lining up the pilot holes so they align with the studs and TV mount. I had to make many pencil marks before 
		I was sure it would be level before drilling. We used to watch our movies on our Macbooks.  What a difference to watch on a big screen!

  <h1>Where my Head is at</h1>
	
  <p><b>24 December 2020</b>:  If you are waiting for your life to get started, there is no time like now.
	This holiday break, I gave to my loved ones like my Mom, Lucy, Mayson and close friends.  Dad doesn't want gifts, but
	he liked the Starbucks Kenya Reserve coffee.  Greg didn't want a present period.  I made time for 
	the activities that I love like downhill skiing, alpine touring, general strength training -- stretched my limits.  Learned to sew
	the buttons back onto my duvet cover, fixed the curtains in Mayson's room, got handy with a power drill.  I'm more intentional about the professional
	projects I work on, and I am thankful for those who helped me.  
	</p>
			  
	<p>Projects now are putting up shelving in the garage, put up a pegboard for commonly used tools.  Work with engineers on
		a social networking concept.  Be present in meetings and give active feedback.

<h1>Morning Runs</h1>

<p><img src="static/img/morningfog.jpg" width="650"></p>

<p><b>10 November 2020</b>:  I pulled my back on October 26 and then reinjured it that same week. :( It 
	was very painful.  I've since recovered, but I have a deeper appreciation for small things like getting out 
	of bed without any trouble.  
	I am having the best time waking up for morning runs outside, rain or shine.  We live in the mountains
	where there are views like this to take in this time of year.  There's something 
	about the rhythm of running that is centering, and I like taking in the day outside first thing.

<h1>Inception</h1>

<p><img src="static/img/inception.jpeg" width="650"></p>

<p><b>07 November 2020</b>:  This is a beautifully shot movie.  The score by Hans Zimmer is brooding and 
	hypnotic.  I like how Christopher Nolan's films all have weight.  He has many gems - "The Prestige" and "The Dark Knight" are stand outs.
	What I love about "Inception" is it was an entirely original concept (no pre-branding like Marvel) given a whopping $160MM budget
	because of the faith the studio had in Nolan.  And it came out beautifully!  All of Nolan's films are 
	<a href="http://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/1202-Spring-2012/DGA-Interview-Christopher-Nolan.aspx" target="_blank">shot on film</a>, 
	not digital video,
	with long-time collaborators like cinematographer,

	creating a singular feel and patina.  </p>


<p>I aggregated the best answers to the mysteries posed in the movie into this post.  Read on only if you've seen the movie.

<h1>Chuckanut Drive Route 11</h1>
<p><img src="static/img/chuckanut.jpg" width="650"></p>
<p><b>06 October 2020</b>:

We drove  <a href="https://www.myscenicdrives.com/drives/washington/chuckanut-drive" target="_blank">Chuckanut Route 11</a> to get there 
and it's breathtaking.  
It's a winding passage that hugs cliffs with stunning views of Skagit and Bellingham Bay.  
This route is part of the original Pacific Highway in Washington.

<p><b>31 July 2020</b>:  I really enjoyed <u>Shoe Dog</u>.  It is both inspirational and hilarious.
Several sections made me laugh out loud.  Loved the part when Buck (Phil Knight) wins over a girl from an obnoxiously
preppy boy during one of his travels.  I've seen an obnoxiously preppy boy or two at Princeton, so it was too funny.

<h1>Zoom and Skype</h1>

<p><img src="static/img/zoom.png" width="350"></p>

		<p><b>26 July 2020</b>:  At one time, Skype was dominant.   Microsoft acquired Skype for <b>$8.5
			billion</b> in 2011.
			Now, Zoom is the new Skype and we're relying on video conferencing more than ever.  Was just curious what happened?
		</p>
		<p>
			Looking into it, Microsoft merged Skype with Lync, its in-house 
			enterprise internet phone service, in order to be packaged under Office.  
			While Microsoft allocated resources to integrating Skype with the rest of its back-end systems, competing
			services like Zoom, What's App, FaceTime, and Houseparty launched and gained
			market share.  In addition, Skype 
			became more difficult to use after it merged under Office.

		<p><b>20 July 2020</b>: Saw Hamilton for the first time a few days ago.  I absolutely loved it.  I love that it's about
			getting what you want, making use of the limited time given to us.  It's Lin-Manuel's
			genius to realize Hamilton was the original badass immigrant.  Started from nothing and rose up to
			change history on the biggest scale.  The musical comes full circle for me.  My AP US History teacher, Dr.
			Conlon, whom I am the biggest fan of and who herself is the biggest fan of Alexander Hamilton taught us early on 
			he's the one that kept US credit from becoming worthless by forcing the US to honor it's debts.  It's wonderful that everyone else is celebrating
			this now as well.   
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		  <p><em>Rise up, When you're living on your knees, You Rise up</em>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>The story made me think of my family's personal history. 
			I can never give my parents enough credit for living the American dream.
			My Dad grew up with little but used his mind to test into academic programs for free of charge.
			One thing I love about him is his supreme confidence in his intellect.  And why not?  He pulled himselt
			out of nothing to earn a PhD from UC Berkeley in Electrical Engineering when that program was at its zenith
			of power.  He told me stories how he lived on a few dollars a day.  Rose up early to work part-time jobs 
			like baking bread for a local store at 4:30AM.  His treat every once in a while was a hot dog from Top Dog.
			These are the stories that live with me.  
		</p>

		<p>
			Eventually he used that PhD to cofound his company, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANADIGICS" target="_blank">Anadigics</a>, 
			in 1985.  The Company went public about 10 years later.

		<h1>Where the Light Is</h1>

<p><img src="static/img/wherethelightis.jpg" width="400"></p>

		<p><b>09 July 2020</b>: John Mayer is one of the best guitar players who's ever lived.  He adds
			his trademark voice and well-crafted songwriting, and that trio is magic. His album "Live in LA: Where the Light is" is amazing.
			He gets on stage solo in front of thousands and blows everyone away.  The quality of playing is just
			off the charts.  The tone on his guitar is just amazing, and last few songs are jaw-dropping.  
			Listening to "Slow Dancing
			in a Burning Room" always makes me pause.

		<h1>I Feel the Need for Speed</h1>
			
		<p><img src="static/img/creative2.jpg" width="650"></p>
						
		<p><b>04 July 2020</b>: When I first started to race triathlons, I was put off by how spending $
			could get you a better time.  I grew up swimming competitively.  There is nothing
			you can buy that makes you swim faster.  Only hard work in the pool.  It's the same for running.
			I guess that's why both of those sports speak to me. </p>
		<p>As you get up the training curve, you realize the right equipment makes a difference.  Nothing will
			ever replace the engine (that's you) and training hard and smart.  But a beautiful bike will make 
			your rides that much more fun.  The Cervelo P5 is like riding a rocket ship. 
		</p>
		<p>I'm thankful for the small group of workout buddies I share training notes with.  This post goes to

		<p><b>27 June 2020</b>: Washington state has some of the most beautiful lakes on this planet.  The best part
			is they are largely untouched gems.  World-class locations you visit by parking along side
			the road.  The water is clear and brisk. You can see small fish swimming around as you wade in.
			This is a picture of <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/232064" target="_blank">Lake Kachess</a>.

		<p>I spent the summers of my youth playing with my friends at the local Racquets Club in leafy Short Hills, NJ.  There, I joined

			Springsteen's voice is humble and meditative.  As a Jersey boy,
			it's heartening to read about one of New Jersey's true legends.  
		<p>
		This book matters to me because when I left Kindle in 2018 I asked my friends at Simon & Schuster to sign my copy of
		the book.  I had some of my most educational and fun negotiations with the team at S&S.  They are sharp, professional, 
		and a real pleasure.  It is signed Colin S., Doug S., and Chrissy F.

			She is the one who taught me how to ride a bike, pushed me to go off a high dive for the first time,
			and she is the glue that holds our family together.  When my brother and I grew up, my mom raised us day in and day 
			out by herself.  My dad was busy at work and is naturally hands off day to day.  She cooked for us 
			three meals a day and did the dishes for every meal, washed our laundry, and did all the shopping on her own.  
			Not once did she ask us to help with the chores.  Incredible.

<p><b>27 February 2020</b>:  There are people in my life who are irreplaceable.  I call them the lights
	in my life.  If you really want to know me then you have to understand what these individuals gave me.
	I swam for Jim Wood at the Berkeley Aquatic Club from age 10 to 18 and he is one of those figures.
	Sadly, Jim passed away in early 2019.
	</p>

<p>I was never the fastest swimmer, but Jim saw in me quiet leadership.  I didn't appreciate 
	his confidence in me then as much as I do now. I wish I could have told him that.  This picture resolution isn't great
	but this is the Jim I know - sitting on the deck at this specific pool where we spent countless hours training.
