		<p>A few days ago I was fortunate to pick up a copy of a book that had a
		major impact on my early career as kernel engineer;</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		  <p><em>The Design and Implementation of the 4.3 BSD UNIX Operating System by
		Samuel J. Leffler, Marshall Kirk McKusick, Michael J. Karels and John
		S. Quarterman</em>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>It was the first authoritative description of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">Berkeley
		UNIX</a>, its
		design and implementation. The book covers the internal structure of the
		4.3 BSD systems and the concepts, data structures and algorithms used in
		implementing the system facilities. But most importantly it was written
		by practitioners and builders and as such gave insights that academic
		text book would never give you.</p>
		
		<p>In those days I was doing an internship at
		<a href="https://www.nikhef.nl/">NIKHEF</a> who were still using a collection of
		PDP 11s and one of my tasks was to get BSD2.9 to run on them. Lots of
		late nights and head scratching, but got it done eventually. I did learn
		how to boot from tape, over and over again (Zen!!). When I returned to
		school, they were about to decommission a PDP 11. I convinced them to
		put it in a old (big) cleaning closet, upgrade the power to the room,
		and I went right back to building out my BSD kernel expertise. I started
		late at Computer Science (28) but worked hard to catch up by getting my
		hands dirty.</p>
		
		<p>When I posted on twitter I found of the book, many of our peers came up
		with a list of other books I had also read from that era.</p>
