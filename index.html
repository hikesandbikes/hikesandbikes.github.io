		<p>7/20/20: Saw Hamilton for the first time a few days ago.  I absolutely loved it.  I love that it's about
			getting what you want, making use of the limited time given to us.  It's Lin-Manuel's
			genius to realize Hamilton was the original badass immigrant.  Started from nothing and rose up to
			change history on the biggest scale.  The musical comes full circle for me.  My AP US History teacher, Dr.
			Conlon, whom I am the biggest fan of and who herself is the biggest fan of Alexander Hamilton taught us early on 
			he's the one that kept US credit from becoming worthless by forcing the US to honor it's debts.  It's wonderful that everyone else is celebrating
			this now as well.

		<p>The story made me think of my family's personal history. 
			I can never give my parents enough credit for living the American dream.
			My Dad grew up with little but used his mind to test into academic programs for free of charge.
			One thing I love about him is his supreme confidence in his intellect.  And why not?  He pulled himselt
			out of nothing to earn a PhD from UC Berkeley in Electrical Engineering when that program was at its zenith
			of power.  He told me stories how he lived on a few dollars a day.  Rose up early to work part-time jobs 
			like baking bread for a local store at 4:30AM.  His treat every once in a while was a hot dog from Top Dog.
			These are the stories that live with me.  
		</p>

		<p>
			Eventually he used that PhD to cofound his company, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANADIGICS">Anadigics</a>, 
			in 1985.  The Company went public about 10 years later.

		<p>7/04/20: When I first started to race triathlons, I was put off by how spending $
			could get you a better time.  I grew up swimming competitively.  There is nothing
			you can buy that makes you swim faster.  Only hard work in the pool.  It's the same for running.
			I guess that's why both of those sports speak to me. </p>
		<p>As you get up the training curve, you realize the right equipment makes a difference.  Nothing will
			ever replace the engine (that's you) and training hard and smart.  But a beautiful bike will make 
			your rides that much more fun.  The Cervelo P5 is like riding a rocket ship. 
		</p>
		<p>I'm thankful for the small group of workout buddies I share training notes with.  This post goes to
			Adam Guren and Dorje Glassman.

			<p>6/30/20: Amazon closed on the acquisition of two sites today out of Fairway Market's banktuptcy.  
				I am enormously proud of this transaction.  Not because the number of assets acquired, but because 
				of what it represents.  This marks the first time Amazon acquired assets out of bankruptcy. 
				We ran into several major blockers along the way.  Some of them we were right to blow through 
				("Amazon doesn't do bankruptcies") but some points of dissession were valid.  This was a high profile transaction.  We didn't want to
				create an unnecessary distraction for the team or for Amazon.
				</p>
			<p> As Lead on the transaction from start to finish, I want to call out several individuals without whom
				we would not have made it.  Pat Waldron who has great instincts and pounded the table to give our team ownership
				internally, Micah Bobo who didn't sleep for several nights to finish legal negotiations on time, Brian Willis my thought 
				partner and who spear-headed the transaction alongside me, Chris Yergan another trusted thought partner who ran the 
				models and navigated our approvals, and Alex Ragonese for his energy, strategic thinking, and his ability to go both high-level 
				and granular.  All this could only happen because of the faith and trust Jeff Helbling entrusted in me.

		<p>6/27/20: Washington state has some of the most beautiful lakes on this planet.  The best part
			is they are largely untouched gems.  World-class locations you visit by parking along side
			the road.  The water is clear and brisk. You can see small fish swimming around as you wade in.
			This is a picture of <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/232064">Lake Kachess</a>.

		<p>I spent the summers of my youth playing with my friends at the local Racquets Club.  There, I joined
			my first swim team, made my first friends, and learned to do a back dive.  All magical.  I'm 
			happy Mayson can enjoy his summers too, when the days are long and packed full of things to do.
			I still remember the fireflies that came out at night in our backyard.

		<p>6/20/20: Springsteen is one of those legendary figures.  Half god half man.  One of those in that 
			stratosphere few attain.  I was drawn to his autobiography because I wanted to learn more about the legend
			and it's an enjoyable read.  Springsteen's voice is humble, meditative, and thoughtful.  As a Jersey boy,
			it's heartening to read about one of New Jersey's true legends.  
		</p>
		<p>
		One of my favorite passages is when he writes about having children. For a man who is accustomed to playing to an audience of
		thousands he said that parents are always the audience for their children.  It is never the other way around.  I
		believe that's true.  
		</p>  
		<p>
		After the mega success of "Born in the USA" Springstreen was loaded.  What struck me is how he and his wife, Patti, 
		would still take motorcycle trips and stay at motels when they could obviously afford much more.  It goes to this 
		dichotomy I see between having wealth and choosing what to do with your wealth.  When I was young I thought having wealth
		meant I lived in a large home with big-set mahogony furniture and paintings.  That was also the definition of having class.
		Now I realize wealth is just the means to do as you want and staying at motels is not in itself low class.  Just as staying
		in an RV is not low class and staying at the Four Seasons does not make you high class.

			This book matters to me because when I left Kindle in 2018 I asked my friends at Simon & Schuster to sign my copy of
			the book.  I had some of my most educational and fun negotiations with the team at S&S.  They are sharp, professional, 
			and a real pleasure.  It is signed Colin Shields, Doug Stambaugh, and Chrissy Festa.

		<h1>Best Mom Ever</h1>

		<div class="asset-content">
		<div class="asset-body">
					
		<p><img src="/static/img/mom.jpeg" width="650" height="650"></p>
		
		<p>6/08/20: I could write forever about my mom.  She is the best ever. 
			She is the one who taught me how to ride a bike, pushed me to go off a high dive for the first time,
			and she is the glue that holds our family together.  When my brother and I grew up, my mom raised us day in and day 
			out by herself.  My dad was busy at work and is naturally hands off day to day.  She cooked for us 
			three meals a day and did the dishes for every meal, washed our laundry, and did all the shopping on her own.  
			Not once did she ask us to help.  Incredible.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I was working in Hong Kong, I developed a large, hard mass in my left check that distorted my appearance.  
			I was scared and tried to ignore the problem.  My mom helped me find the right surgeons.  She asked the difficult 
			questions to surgeons that I was afraid to ask.  She wasn’t afraid to look stupid in front of surgeons to get to the 
			right outcome.  “Will there be a scar?  How will you make the incision?  Can you take a different approach that reduces 
			the appearance of the surgery?  Can we hire a plastic surgeon for the suture instead of the regular one?  (We did.)  As a 
			mother please take care of my son.  For me.”  She was the shield that I could hide behind.  I would have tried to look tough 
			and undaunted on my own, like I didn’t care about a nasty appearance or wasn’t so superficial to care that much about my looks.  
			But I did care and I was scared and she helped me through it.    
		</p>
		<p>
			The surgeons had no idea what it was.  The only solution was to have surgery to take it out. They said the surgery could leave 
			half of my face paralyzed or drooped.  I walked into the surgery room not knowing what to expect and prepared to lead a much different 
			life if I had to.  Those close to me don’t see it now, but it was terrifying.  For two weeks post the surgery, I didn’t leave my bed, 
			I didn’t shower, I didn’t talk, I didn’t chew, or move my mouth. My mom took care of me the entire time.
		</p>
		<p>
			I owe a debt to my mom I can never repay.  She means the world to me and always will.

		<h1>Tiny Toons Music Episode</h1>

		<p>5/15/20: There are some things in life that just bring a smile to my face.  
			To this day, the Tiny Toons Adventures musical episode is one of them.
			I watched hours of TV growing up and this is one of the very best TV has to offer.
			Instantly catchy and entirely original songs paired with fun themes like Arabian Nights.  
			Two classics are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulsloBRDFzA">They Might be Giant's "Istanbul (Constantinople)</a> 
			and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJBLP3AXk0">Montana Max's (Danny Cooksey) "Money It's what I want</a>."  
			
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm a big fan of cartoons that are actually geared for an adult audience.  The Monty Max video 
			brings a smile to my face every time.  No child is going to understand who the IRS is and that's
			part of why it's so good.  

		</p>
		<p>
			Side note.  My hours of cartoon watching a day was a bonus of having parents that didn't micro-manage
			how to spend my time.  They never pushed me to study.  They showed me the bar of what they had achieved a
			and made it clear I should meet that bar, but they didn't tell me <em>how </em> to do it. Wise move
			on their part.
