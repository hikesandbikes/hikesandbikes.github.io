<h1>The Fall of Skype</h1>

<p><img src="static/img/zoom.png" width="650"></p>

		<p>26 July 2020:  At one time, Skype was dominant.   Microsoft acquired Skype for <b>$8.5
			billion</b> in 2011.
			Now, Zoom is the new Skype and we're relying on video conferencing more than ever.  Was just curious what happened?
		</p>
		<p>
			Looking into it, Microsoft focused on the enterprise market after the acquisition.  It merged Skype with Lync, its in-house 
			enterprise internet phone service, in order to be packaged under Office.  
			While Microsoft allocated resources to integrating Skype with the rest of its back-end systems, competing
			services like Zoom, What's App, FaceTime, and Houseparty launched and gained
			market share.  In addition, Skype 
			became more difficult to use after it merged under Office. It required a login and it introduced
			bad user interface changes as it tried to accommode enterprise and consumer user needs.    	
		</p>
		<p>
			The LA Times' <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-skype-microsoft-20180511-story.html">
				Don't Skype Me</a> summarizes the issues, and it came out <em>two years</em> ago.  The fall of
				Skype was a long time in the making and then Covid made the fall precipitous. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It's a lesson to not be afraid of "saturated" markets.
			Zoom wasn't the first video conference platform and it won't be the last.  But it's winning now
			because it doesn't require a user account to use it, you can join a meeting through a browser 
			without installing software, and the user interface is clean.  It's a good product with frictionless 
			adoption.  
			Similarly, Chrome wasn't the first internet browser but now has ~60% market segment share.  It won 
			because it is open source, and it traded off faster speed and stability against using more RAM, something users were 
			willing to do because of diminishing computing costs.

		<p>20 July 2020: Saw Hamilton for the first time a few days ago.  I absolutely loved it.  I love that it's about
			getting what you want, making use of the limited time given to us.  It's Lin-Manuel's
			genius to realize Hamilton was the original badass immigrant.  Started from nothing and rose up to
			change history on the biggest scale.  The musical comes full circle for me.  My AP US History teacher, Dr.
			Conlon, whom I am the biggest fan of and who herself is the biggest fan of Alexander Hamilton taught us early on 
			he's the one that kept US credit from becoming worthless by forcing the US to honor it's debts.  It's wonderful that everyone else is celebrating
			this now as well.   
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		  <p><em>Rise up, When you're living on your knees, You Rise up</em>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>The story made me think of my family's personal history. 
			I can never give my parents enough credit for living the American dream.
			My Dad grew up with little but used his mind to test into academic programs for free of charge.
			One thing I love about him is his supreme confidence in his intellect.  And why not?  He pulled himselt
			out of nothing to earn a PhD from UC Berkeley in Electrical Engineering when that program was at its zenith
			of power.  He told me stories how he lived on a few dollars a day.  Rose up early to work part-time jobs 
			like baking bread for a local store at 4:30AM.  His treat every once in a while was a hot dog from Top Dog.
			These are the stories that live with me.  
		</p>

		<p>
			Eventually he used that PhD to cofound his company, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANADIGICS">Anadigics</a>, 
			in 1985.  The Company went public about 10 years later.

		<p>04 July 2020: When I first started to race triathlons, I was put off by how spending $
			could get you a better time.  I grew up swimming competitively.  There is nothing
			you can buy that makes you swim faster.  Only hard work in the pool.  It's the same for running.
			I guess that's why both of those sports speak to me. </p>
		<p>As you get up the training curve, you realize the right equipment makes a difference.  Nothing will
			ever replace the engine (that's you) and training hard and smart.  But a beautiful bike will make 
			your rides that much more fun.  The Cervelo P5 is like riding a rocket ship. 
		</p>
		<p>I'm thankful for the small group of workout buddies I share training notes with.  This post goes to
			Adam Guren and Dorje Glassman.

			<p>30 June 2020: Amazon closed on the acquisition of two sites today out of Fairway Market's banktuptcy.  
				I am enormously proud of this transaction.  Not because the number of assets acquired, but because 
				of what it represents.  This marks the first time Amazon acquired assets out of bankruptcy. 
				We ran into several major blockers along the way.  Some of them we were right to blow through 
				("Amazon doesn't do bankruptcies") but some points of dissension were valid.  This was a high profile transaction.  We didn't want to
				create an unnecessary distraction for the team or for Amazon.
				</p>
			<p> I want to call out several individuals without whom
				we would not have made it.  Pat W who has great instincts and pounded the table to give our team ownership
				internally, Micah B who didn't sleep for several nights to finish legal negotiations on time, Brian W my thought 
				partner and who spear-headed the transaction alongside me, Chris Y another trusted thought partner who ran the 
				models and navigated our approvals, and Alex R for his energy and strategic thinking.  All this could only 
				happen because of the faith and trust Jeff H entrusted in me.

		<p>27 June 2020: Washington state has some of the most beautiful lakes on this planet.  The best part
			is they are largely untouched gems.  World-class locations you visit by parking along side
			the road.  The water is clear and brisk. You can see small fish swimming around as you wade in.
			This is a picture of <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/232064">Lake Kachess</a>. 
		</p>
		
		<p>I spent the summers of my youth playing with my friends at the local Racquets Club in leafy Short Hills, NJ.  There, I joined
			my first swim team, made my first friends, and learned to do a back dive.  I'm 
			happy Mayson can enjoy his summers too, when the days are long and packed.

		<h1>Born to Run</h1>

		<p><img src="/static/img/springsteen.jpg" width="650" height="650"></p>
		
		<p>20 June 2020: Springsteen is one of those legendary figures.  Half god half man.  One of those in that 
			stratosphere few attain.  I was drawn to his autobiography because I wanted to learn more about the legend.  
			Springsteen's voice is humble and meditative.  As a Jersey boy,
			it's heartening to read about one of New Jersey's true legends.  Below are a few parts that stuck out to me.  
		</p>
		<ul>
			<p><li>
				<b>Humility:</b>  Springsteen is one of the greats, yet his voice is humble.  
				His voice is that of the journeyman: hard-working, love for his craft, and approachable.  
				I find the true greats are all like that.
				They make you believe that you too can become great.  
			</li></p>
			<p><li>
				<b>Race:</b>  Springsteen's relationship with his black saxophonist, Clarence Clemons, spans decades and they share 
				something elemental together: a deep love for music.  Together they are unstoppable.  Clarence shields
				Bruce, and Bruce gives Clarence the largest platform in the world to share his saxophone.
				Neither will ever fully understand 
				what it means to live in the other's skin,
				but each transforms the other into something greater.
			</li></p>
			<p><li>
				<b>Hard-work:</b>  Springsteen worked himself to the top. He doesn't profess to have the most beautiful voice.  
				He's a sum of his parts: beautiful song-writing, band leadership, deep character-driven albums, all out stage performances;
				together it creates something potent.  I loved reading that.  Everyone has flaws; it's what you to do with your strengths 
				and what you do with your weaknesses that matters.  
			</li></p>
			<p><li>
				<b>Children</b>:  For a man who is accustomed to playing to an audience of
				thousands he writes parents are always the audience for their children.  It is never the other way around.  I
				believe that's true.
			</li></p>
			<p><li>
				<b>Wealth</b>:  After the mega success of "Born in the USA" Springstreen was loaded.  He and his wife, Patti, 
				would still take motorcycle trips and stay at motels when they could afford more.  I grew up believing wealth
				was a large home with big-set mahogony furniture and paintings.  That was also the definition of having class.
				Wealth is the means to do as you want.  And class is something else entirely.   
			</li></p>

		This book matters to me because when I left Kindle in 2018 I asked my friends at Simon & Schuster to sign my copy of
		the book.  I had some of my most educational and fun negotiations with the team at S&S.  They are sharp, professional, 
		and a real pleasure.  It is signed Colin Shields, Doug Stambaugh, and Chrissy Festa.

		<h1>The Best Mom</h1>

					
		<p><img src="/static/img/mom.jpeg" width="650" height="650"></p>
		
		<p>08 June 2020: I could write forever about my mom.   
			She is the one who taught me how to ride a bike, pushed me to go off a high dive for the first time,
			and she is the glue that holds our family together.  When my brother and I grew up, my mom raised us day in and day 
			out by herself.  My dad was busy at work and is naturally hands off day to day.  She cooked for us 
			three meals a day and did the dishes for every meal, washed our laundry, and did all the shopping on her own.  
			Not once did she ask us to help with the chores.  Incredible.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I was working in Hong Kong, I developed a large, hard mass in my left check that distorted my appearance.  
			I was scared and tried to ignore the problem.  My mom helped me find the right surgeons.  She asked the difficult 
			questions to surgeons that I was afraid to ask.  She wasn’t afraid to look stupid to get to the 
			right outcome.  “Will there be a scar?  How will you make the incision?  Can you take a different approach that reduces 
			the appearance of the surgery?  Can we hire a plastic surgeon for the suture instead of the regular one?  (We did.)  As a 
			mother please take care of my son.  For me.”  She was the shield that I could hide behind.  I would have tried to look tough 
			and undaunted on my own, like I wasn’t so superficial to care that much about my looks.  
			But I did care and she helped me through it.    
		</p>
		<p>
			The only solution was have surgery to remove it, but surgery could cause
			half of my face to be paralyzed or drooped.  I walked into the surgery room not knowing what to expect and prepared to lead a much different 
			life if I had to.  Those close to me don’t see it now, but it was terrifying.  For two weeks post the surgery, I didn’t leave my bed, 
			I didn’t shower, I didn’t talk, I didn’t chew, or move my mouth. My mom took care of me the entire time.
		</p>
		<p>
			I owe a debt to my mom I can never repay.  She means the world to me and always will.

		<h1>Tiny Toons Music Episode</h1>

					
		<p><img src="/static/img/tinytoons.jpg" width="650"></p>
		
		<p>15 May 2020: There are some things in life that just bring a smile to my face.  
			To this day, the Tiny Toons Adventures musical episode is one of them.
			I watched hours of TV growing up.  This is one of the very best.
			Instantly catchy and entirely original songs paired with fun themes like Arabian Nights.
			Two classics are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulsloBRDFzA">They Might be Giant's "Istanbul (Constantinople)</a> 
			and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntJBLP3AXk0">Montana Max's (Danny Cooksey) "Money It's what I want</a>."

		<h1>Tips for a Better Work Day</h1>

		<p>21 April 2020: Ten months into joining a strategic initiative, I shared a list of tips for a better work day with my org.
			I find these lessons just as applicable now.  I hope you find them as helpful as I do.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<p><li>
				<b>Say hi:</b>  With new team members joining all the time, it’s easy to focus on the people you know or get caught up in your job and just focus on that.   
				Say hi to strangers and to old colleagues.  Your day will be better for it.  Also, it’s about the long game.  At some point you’re going to rely on 
				these teammates to get your job done.  Build the ark before the flood.
			</li></p>
			<p><li>
				<b>Speak up:</b>  One, I literally can’t hear you!  Two, as a concept we know broadly where we want to be 
				but there is a lot we don’t know.  We’re testing and learning.  So speak up if you have ideas.  
				Also, nobody here is a mind reader.  If you want something or want to get to somewhere raise your hand so folks know.  
				It’s better than waiting and being disappointed.  
			</li></p>
			<p><li>
				<b>Use heart:</b>   This one sounds squishy, but it’s true.  
				Whatever it is, people can usually feel the level of care you put into something. 
				There’s always parts of the job that are less fun.  Where possible, try to maximize the 
				time spent per day where you’re in the zone and feeling the flow. 
			</li></p>
			<p><li>
				<b>Recharge:</b> You need to be self-aware enough to know what recharges you and what works for you.  
				Make sure you make time for it.  
			</li></p>
			<p><li>
				<b>Stand your ground:</b> Fast moving (and effective) orgs don’t operate by consensus.  
				If you feel strongly about something hold fast and bring in a tie-breaker if needed. 
			</li></p>
		</ul>
