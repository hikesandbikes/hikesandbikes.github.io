		<p>7/20/20: Saw Hamilton for the first time a few days ago.  I absolutely loved it.  I love that it's about
			getting what you want, making use of the limited time given to us.  It's Lin-Manuel's
			genius to realize Hamilton was the original badass immigrant.  Started from nothing and rose up to
			change history on the biggest scale.  The musical comes full circle for me.  My AP US History teacher, Dr.
			Conlon, whom I am the biggest fan of and who herself is the biggest fan of Alexander Hamilton taught us early on 
			he's the one that kept US credit from becoming worthless by forcing the US to honor it's debts.  It's wonderful that everyone else is celebrating
			this now as well.

		<p>The story made me think of my family's personal history. 
			I can never give my parents enough credit for living the American dream.
			My Dad grew up with little but used his mind to test into academic programs for free of charge.
			One thing I love about him is his supreme confidence in his intellect.  And why not?  He pulled himselt
			out of nothing to earn a PhD from UC Berkeley in Electrical Engineering when that program was at its zenith
			of power.  He told me stories how he lived on a few dollars a day.  Rose up early to work part-time jobs 
			like baking break for a local store at 4:30AM.  His treat every once in a while was a hot dog from Top Dog.
			These are the stories that fuel me.  
		</p>

			Eventually he used that PhD to cofound his company, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANADIGICS">Anadigics</a>, 
			in 1985.  The Company went public about 10 years.

						<p>7/20/20: When I first started to race triathlons, I was put off by how spending $
							could get you a better time.  I grew up swimming competitively.  There is nothing
						you can buy that makes you swim faster.  Only hard work in the pool.  It's the same for running.
						I guess that's why both of those sports speak to me. </p>
						<p>As you get up the training curve though, you realize the right equipment really makes a difference.
							The Cervelo P5 is like riding a rocket ship.  It's a terribly fun to ride and very addicting.
							Love the sleek design </p>
