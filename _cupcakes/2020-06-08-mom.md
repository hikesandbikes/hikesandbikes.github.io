<p>I could write forever about my mom.   
She is the one who taught me how to ride a bike, pushed me to go off a high dive for the first time,
			and she is the glue that holds our family together.  When my brother and I grew up, my mom raised us day in and day 
			out.  My dad was busy at work and is naturally hands off day to day.  She cooked for us 
			three meals a day and did the dishes for every meal, washed our laundry, and did all the shopping on her own.  
			Not once did she ask us to help with the chores.  Incredible.

Many years ago when I needed to have a surgery done, my mom helped me find the right surgeons. She asked the difficult questions to surgeons that I was afraid to ask. She wasn’t afraid to look stupid to get to the right outcome.   I would have tried to look tough 
and undaunted on my own, like I wasn’t so superficial to care about how the surgery might affect my appearance.  
But I did care and she asked the right questions on my behalf.  She was the shield that I could hide behind.

The surgery was amazingly successful.  When my mom thanked my surgeon after the surgery, the surgeon said, "Thank God. Not me.  It was a 
miraculous procedure."  

<p>
I owe a debt to my mom I can never repay.  She means the world to me and always will.
