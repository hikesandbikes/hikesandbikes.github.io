			<h1>About</h1>
			<h2>This is Josh Huang's blog. It's my intention to write something useful.</h2>
			<br>
			<p>I am a Product Manager leading Merchant Experience for <a href="https://one.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon One</a>.  It came to me put 
				in one place some things I love.  
				  
			</p>
			
			<p>
				My thanks goes to <a href=" https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2019/">Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science.</a>  
				The course was recently featured in the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-local-correspondents/how-harvards-star-computer-science-professor-built-a-distance-learning-empire">New Yorker</a>.  
				That course gave me the mindset, confidence, and
				tools to create this website from scratch using GitHub pages.  This page utilizes a small fraction of the 
				learning provided in the course.  It feels great to bypass the usual website providers like Word Press. It's all
				free on GitHub.   No one is paying me to write this.  Give credit where
				it is due!
