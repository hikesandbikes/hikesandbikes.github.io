			<h1>About</h1>
			<h2>This is Josh Huang's blog. I write about the things that interest me.</h2>

			<p>I lead Business Development for Amazon's physical stores and live in Seattle, WA with my 
				lovely wife and son, Lucy and Mayson.  It came to me put in one place all the things I love.  
				I come here to put down my latest thoughts and I leave with inspiration.

				My thanks goes to <a href=" https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2019/">Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science.</a>  
				When the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-local-correspondents/how-harvards-star-computer-science-professor-built-a-distance-learning-empire">New Yorker</a>  
				writes about it, it's gotta be real.  That course gave me the mindset, confidence, and
				tools to create this website from scratch using GitHub pages.  And this page utilizes a small fraction of the 
				learning provided in the course.  It feels great to bypass the usual website providers like Word Press, Wix,
				or Squarespace where you need to pay for domain hosting and are locked into set templates.  It's all for
				free on GitHub.  Check out more @https://pages.github.com.  No one is paying me to write this.  Give credit where
				credit is due!
