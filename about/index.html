			<h1>About</h1>
			<h2>This is Josh Huang's blog. It's my intention to write something useful.</h2>
			<br>
			<p>I created this website from scratch.  It's hosted on my GitHub repository.  I can edit, push, and make changes live all for free.
				 
				This website initially started as a place where I could place my answers to computer programming problem sets.  It evolved
				to a blog, and now I'm using it to gauge interest in new projects I'm creating.  If you would like me to continue to create 
				products I preview here, please join the waitlist!
				  
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If you are interested in creating something similar, I recommend checking out <a href=" https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2019/">Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</a> to understand programming basics.  
				The course was recently featured in the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-local-correspondents/how-harvards-star-computer-science-professor-built-a-distance-learning-empire">New Yorker</a>.  
				From there follow this link to <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> to build your website for free.
