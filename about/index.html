			<h1>About</h1>
			<h2>Welcome to Storyboard!  This is where I write about the things that interest me.</h2>

			<h4>I lead Business Development for Amazon for its physical formats.  I live in Seattle, WA with my 
				lovely wife and son, Lucy and Mayson.  It came to me put in one place all the things I love.  
				That's why I created Storyboard.  I come here for inspiration to put down my latest thoughts.

				My thanks goes to Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science.  That course has given me the mindset
				and tools to create this website from scratch using GitHub pages.  It feels great to bypass
				the usual website providers like Word Press where you need to pay for domain hosting.  It's all for
				free on GitHub.  Check out more @https://pages.github.com.
