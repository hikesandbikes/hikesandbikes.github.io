			<p>I climbed the Flatirons in Boulder, CO for the first time in 2013 with a dear buddy, Daniel Curtis.  It was a few days before
				a major surgery.  It was also my first time rock climbing!  Our guide had a lot of faith in us.  More likely, our guide
				had a lot of faith in his skills.  He was top-knotch.  I'll never forget scaling it and looking down
				from the top.  A gorgeous view.  This picture reminds me of that memory.
