<p><b>30 June 2020</b>: Amazon closed on the acquisition of two sites today out of Fairway Market's banktuptcy.  
I am enormously proud of this transaction.  Not because the number of assets acquired, but because 
				of what it represents.  This marks the first time Amazon acquired assets out of bankruptcy. 
				We ran into several major blockers along the way.  Some of them we were right to blow through 
				("Amazon doesn't do bankruptcies") but some points of dissension were valid.  This was a high profile transaction.  We didn't want to
				create an unnecessary distraction for the team or for Amazon.
				</p>
<p> I want to call out several individuals without whom
				we would not have made it.  Pat W who has great instincts and pounded the table to give our team ownership
				internally, Micah B who didn't sleep for several nights to finish legal negotiations on time, Brian W my thought 
				partner and who spear-headed the transaction alongside me, Chris Y another trusted thought partner who ran the 
				models and navigated our approvals, and Alex R for his energy and strategic thinking.  All this could only 
				happen because of the faith and trust Jeff H entrusted in me.
