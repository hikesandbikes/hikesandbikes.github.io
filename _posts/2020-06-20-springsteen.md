		<p>Springsteen is one of those legendary figures.  Half god half man.  One of those in that 
			stratosphere few attain.  I was drawn to his autobiography because I wanted to learn more about the legend.  
			Springsteen's voice is humble and meditative.  As a Jersey boy,
			it's heartening to read about one of New Jersey's true legends.  Below are a few parts that stuck out to me.  
		</p>
		<ul>
			<p><li>
				<b>Humility:</b>  Springsteen is one of the greats, yet his voice is humble.  
				His voice is that of the journeyman: hard-working, love for his craft, and approachable.  
				I find the true greats are all like that.
				They make you believe that you too can become great.  
			</li></p>
			<p><li>
				<b>Race:</b>  Springsteen's relationship with his black saxophonist, Clarence Clemons, spans decades and they share 
				something elemental together: a deep love for music.  Together they are unstoppable.  Clarence shields
				Bruce, and Bruce gives Clarence the largest platform in the world to share his saxophone.
				Neither will ever fully understand 
				what it means to live in the other's skin,
				but each transforms the other into something greater.
			</li></p>
			<p><li>
				<b>Hard-work:</b>  Springsteen worked himself to the top. He doesn't profess to have the most beautiful voice.  
				He's a sum of his parts: beautiful song-writing, band leadership, deep character-driven albums, all out stage performances;
				together it creates something potent.  I loved reading that.  Everyone has flaws; it's what you to do with your strengths 
				and what you do with your weaknesses that matters.  
			</li></p>
			<p><li>
				<b>Children</b>:  For a man who is accustomed to playing to an audience of
				thousands he writes parents are always the audience for their children.  It is never the other way around.  I
				believe that's true.
			</li></p>
			<p><li>
				<b>Wealth</b>:  After the mega success of "Born in the USA" Springstreen was loaded.  He and his wife, Patti, 
				would still take motorcycle trips and stay at motels when they could afford more.  I grew up believing wealth
				was a large home with big-set mahogony furniture and paintings.  That was also the definition of having class.
				Wealth is the means to do as you want.  And class is something else entirely.
