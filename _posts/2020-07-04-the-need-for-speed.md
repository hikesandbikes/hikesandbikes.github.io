If you're going to ride a P5, then you're going to need to back it up.  Nothing looks worse
than someone who flashes a lot of $ on a bike but then can't bring it on the course.  The good things is training is really fun.  ItI've put down
some thoughts on training tips that have helped me over the years.

<p>I grew up swimming competitively for the Berkeley Aquatic Club.  We did double practices three days a week.  On those days, I would wake up at 4:30AM to get in a morning session.  These were for an hour and a half and about five to six thousand yards.  After school, I trained for another two and a half hours and averaged 8,500 yards in the pool.  We would ramp that up or down based on where we were in the season.

		<p>I'm thankful for the small group of workout buddies I share training notes with.  This post goes to
			Adam Guren and Dorje Glassman.
