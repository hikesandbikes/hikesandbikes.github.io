If you're going to ride a P5, then you're going to need to back it up.  Nothing looks worse
than someone who flashes a lot of $ on a bike but then can't bring it on the course.

<p>
I've listed out some hard-won lessons from training for triathlons over the years.  I'm writing this list just as much for myself as I am to help you, because it's very easy to fall into these traps.

<p>  
Ramping up too quickly leads to injury and burn out.  It's about the long game.  Sure, it feels
great to go from zero to hero.  But if you need a week to recover from a hero session, you've missed out on valuable training.  Training that would get you faster more quickly.  Most workouts should be aimed at developing an aerobic base you can stand on to hammer harder, intense work outs periodically.  You need all types of training, but the aerobic stuff where you aren't killing yourself is by far the largest portion of training.

<p> I grew up swimming competitively for the Berkeley Aquatic Club.  We did double practices three days a week.  On those days, I would wake up at 4:30AM to get in a morning session of 1.5 hours averaging 5,000 - 6,000 yards.  After school, the afternoon sesson was 2.5 hours averaging 8,500 yards.  All the schedule was ~30 hours/week of training of about 65,000 - 70,000 yards.
