If you're going to ride a P5, then you're going to need to back it up.  Nothing looks worse
than someone who flashes a lot of $ on a bike but then can't bring it on the course.  Below are some
hard-won lessons I've learned from training over the years.

<p> I grew up swimming competitively for the Berkeley Aquatic Club.  We did double practices three days a week.  On those days, I would wake up at 4:30AM to get in a morning session of 1.5 hours averaging 5,000 - 6,000 yards.  After school, the afternoon sesson was 2.5 hours averaging 8,500 yards.  All the schedule was ~30 hours/week of training of about 65,000 - 70,000 yards.
