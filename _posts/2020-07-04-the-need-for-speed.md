If you're going to ride a P5, then you're going to need to back it up.  Nothing looks worse
than someone who flashes a lot of $ on a bike but then can't bring it on the course.  I've put
some thoughts on training tips for triathlon that have helped me over the years.

<p> I grew up swimming competitively for the Berkeley Aquatic Club.  We did double practices three days a week.  On those days, I would wake up at 4:30AM to get in a morning session.  These were for an hour and a half and about five to six thousand yards.  After school, I trained for another two and a half hours and averaged 8,500 yards in the pool.  All in I trained ~30 hours/week including dry land training.  Over the years I've kept a baseline fitness from all those sessions in the pool.
