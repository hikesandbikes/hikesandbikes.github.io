If you're going to ride a P5, then you're going to need to back it up.  Nothing looks worse
than someone who flashes a lot of $ on a bike but then can't bring it on the course.  
</p>

<p>
I've listed out some hard-won lessons from training for triathlons over the years.  I'm writing this list just as much for myself as I am to help others, because it's very easy to fall into these traps.  
 </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Slow Ramp.</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>  
Ramping up too quickly leads to injury and burn out.  It's about the long game.  Sure, it feels
great to go from zero to hero.  But if you need a week to recover from a hero session, you've missed out on valuable training.  Training that would get you faster more quickly.  Most workouts should be aimed at developing an aerobic base you can stand on so you can reach up and hammer hard, intense work outs periodically.  You need it all, aerobic training and intense workouts, but the aerobic stuff where you aren't killing yourself is the largest portion of training.  
</p>

<p>  
The easiest way to fall into this trap is to base your expectations on where you were a few months or years ago.  You have to be realistic with where you are and patient.   
</p>
<p> I grew up swimming competitively for the Berkeley Aquatic Club.  We did double practices three days a week.  On those days, I would wake up at 4:30AM to get in a morning session of 1.5 hours averaging 5,000 - 6,000 yards per practice.  After school, the afternoon sesson was 2.5 hours averaging 8,500 yards per practice.  All in the schedule was ~30 hours/week of training of about 65,000 - 70,000 yards.   
</p>
<p> Sometimes when I miss the feel of the water, I'll drop in the pool and do 4000 yards even though I haven't swam for months or even years.  I don't feel it at the time, but the result is overwork and injury to my shoulders. It is much smarter to end the first few sessions early even though I feel I can do more.   
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Grab a training buddy.</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>  
Like anything in life, study with those smarter than you in school, work out with those who are faster, work professionally with those who are more skilled because in each scenario, you know where the bar is and you'll work harder to get there. Even if you enjoy working out on your own, having a buddy will motivate you and you'll be surprised by what you learn about yourself.  You don't know what you don't know and a buddy will push you to find out.  Your buddy must also be commited to the long-term for their training and for their relationship with you.  
</p>
<p>
Your buddy must also take the long-view for their training and for their relationship with you. You don't want to train with someone who is vindictive or after short-term gains.  A training buddy is a 
buddy first and then the training comes after.
