<p><b>31 July 2020</b>:  I really enjoyed <u>Shoe Dog</u>.  It is both inspirational and hilarious.
			Several sections made me laugh out loud.  Loved the part when Buck wins over a girl from an obnoxiously
			preppy boy during one of his travels.  I've seen an obnoxious preppy boy or two at Princeton, so it was too funny.
</p>
		
<p>
			It also offers an unflinching look at the sacrifices made to 
			build Nike.  I believe in the power of sport to change lives for the better and an 
			entrepreneural spirit.  I identify wholeheartedly with this book's message.  Sport can be life-changing.  
			Growing up as a competitive swimmer taught me the joy of camaraderie and gave me the opportunities
			to build confidence and fortitude. It taught me time management and made me into a better student.  
		</p>

<p> Read this several years ago, but I keep returning to a section early on before the founding of Nike.  Buck's
			father didn't approve of Phil's decision to create an import export company.
			His father valued "respectability" and that meant a traditional path.  
			Phil, however, <em>didn't</em> value looking respectable so he took chances.  He kept at his import/export business 
			and we all know how the story ends.
