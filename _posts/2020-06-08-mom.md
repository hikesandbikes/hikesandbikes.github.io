When I was working in Hong Kong, I developed a large, hard mass in my left check that distorted my appearance.  
			I was scared and tried to ignore the problem.  My mom helped me find the right surgeons.  She asked the difficult 
			questions to surgeons that I was afraid to ask.  She wasn’t afraid to look stupid to get to the 
			right outcome.  “Will there be a scar?  How will you make the incision?  Can you take a different approach that reduces 
			the appearance of the surgery?  Can we hire a plastic surgeon for the suture instead of the regular one?  (We did.)  As a 
			mother please take care of my son.  For me.”  She was the shield that I could hide behind.  I would have tried to look tough 
			and undaunted on my own, like I wasn’t so superficial to care that much about my looks.  
			But I did care and she helped me through it.    
</p>
<p>
			The only solution was have surgery to remove it, but surgery could cause
			half of my face to be paralyzed or drooped.  I walked into the surgery room not knowing what to expect and prepared to lead a much different 
			life if I had to.  Those close to me don’t see it now, but it was terrifying.  For two weeks post the surgery, I didn’t leave my bed, 
			I didn’t shower, I didn’t talk, I didn’t chew, or move my mouth. My mom took care of me the entire time.
</p>

			I owe a debt to my mom I can never repay.  She means the world to me and always will.
