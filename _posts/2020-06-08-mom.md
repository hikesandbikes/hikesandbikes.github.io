<p>I could write forever about my mom.   
			She is the one who taught me how to ride a bike, pushed me to go off a high dive for the first time,
			and she is the glue that holds our family together.  When my brother and I grew up, my mom raised us day in and day 
			out by herself.  My dad was busy at work and is naturally hands off day to day.  She cooked for us 
			three meals a day and did the dishes for every meal, washed our laundry, and did all the shopping on her own.  
			Not once did she ask us to help with the chores.  Incredible.

When I was working in Hong Kong, I developed a large, hard mass in my left check that distorted my appearance. My mom helped me find the right surgeons. She asked the difficult questions to surgeons that I was afraid to ask. She wasn’t afraid to look stupid to get to the right outcome.   The surgery was amazingly successful.  When my mom thanked my surgeon, Dr. Caruana, after the surgery, the Dr. Caruana said, "Thank God. Not me.  It was a 
miraculous surgery."

<p>
She was the shield that I could hide behind.  I would have tried to look tough 
and undaunted on my own, like I wasn’t so superficial to care that much about my looks.  
But I did care and she asked the right questions on my behalf.
</p>
<p> 			
The surgery could cause half of my face to be paralyzed or drooped.  I walked into the surgery room not knowing what to expect and prepared to lead a much different 
			life if I had to.  For two weeks post the surgery, I didn’t leave my bed, 
			I didn’t shower, I didn’t talk, I didn’t chew, or move my mouth. My mom took care of me the entire time.
</p>
<p>
			I owe a debt to my mom I can never repay.  She means the world to me and always will.
