<b> Question: How do the characters kick back to real life? </b> 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Reality - Plane </li>
<li>Level 1 - Van - Yusuf </li>
<li>Level 2 - Hotel - Arthur </li>
<li>Level 3 - Arctic - Eames </li>
<li>Level 4 - Limbo - Saito, Ariadne, Cobb, Fischer </li>
</ul>

<p>Yusuf - is in level 1, wakes up when the timer goes off in the plane.</p>
<p>Arthur - wakes up from level 2 with the kick when the van hits the water, then wakes up into reality when the timer goes off. </p>
<p>Eames - wakes up from level 3 when the elevator crashes, then wakes up from level 2 when the van hits the water, then wakes up into reality when the timer goes off. </p>
<p>Ariadne and Fischer - wake up from level 4/limbo my killing themselves (jumping off the porch), wake up from level 3 when the elevator crashes, then wake up from level 2 when the van hits the water, then wake up into reality when the timer goes off.
<p>Saito and Cobb - In limbo, Cobb finds Saito, Saito kills Cobb then himself, waking up into level 3 in time for the elevator crash to wake them into level 2.  I do not know how Cobb and Saito make it out of level 1 since they are both left drowning in the sinking van.
